00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
A FILM BY
DANIEL HENDLER

00:13.583 --> 00:15.708
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY
NATALIA ZITO

00:18.000 --> 00:20.875
THIS FICTION IS BASED ON REAL EVENTS.

00:20.958 --> 00:21.791
They are late.

00:21.875 --> 00:23.708
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO REAL PERSONS IS COINCIDENTAL.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.416
Almost ten minutes late.

00:26.666 --> 00:28.291
Assholes.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.625
-I'll get going.
-Calm down.

00:34.291 --> 00:35.666
I am calm, Olga.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.708
I'm just saying we better wait here.

00:45.166 --> 00:46.208
There they are.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.166
Got it, thanks.

00:53.916 --> 00:55.083
Good evening.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.958
-Hi, Daniel.
-How are you doing?

00:57.458 --> 01:01.291
-Hello, how are you?
-I'm Myriam. I'm her daughter.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.666
I'm her other daughter, Olga.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.291
-How will the operation be?
-The operation?

01:06.791 --> 01:09.166
Yes, the procedure.
I don't know how to call it.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.458
Does she know what's going to happen?

01:11.541 --> 01:13.458
She knows you're coming to see her.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.791
She doesn't know where she's going.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.125
She knows they'll run some tests on her.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.666
Rather late, isn't it?

01:21.041 --> 01:22.500
Listen.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.125
I don't want her to have a hard time.

01:25.208 --> 01:28.041
-I don't want to have a hard time, either.
-Let them speak, Miri.

01:28.125 --> 01:32.083
Look, ma'am, if the patient resists,
if she gets aggressive,

01:32.166 --> 01:33.750
sometimes we must take action.

01:33.833 --> 01:35.666
What kind of action?

01:35.750 --> 01:37.125
Sedation, for example.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.875
Best not to make that decision
in her presence.

01:41.958 --> 01:43.000
Correct.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.791
A code is usually adopted.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.125
A sign.

01:46.708 --> 01:51.750
To inform us
when you are willing to activate sedation.

01:51.833 --> 01:52.833
A hand clap?

01:52.916 --> 01:55.583
It should be something
that doesn't alert the patient.

01:55.666 --> 01:58.625
A gesture. A keyword.

02:00.416 --> 02:01.625
"Coat."

02:01.708 --> 02:02.916
"Coat"?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.750
We could say "Put on your coat."

02:07.500 --> 02:09.625
It's better to choose something concise.

02:10.666 --> 02:12.166
"It's for your own sake."

02:13.875 --> 02:17.541
The keyword. "It's for your own sake."

02:17.625 --> 02:19.875
-"It's for your own sake"?
-It could be confusing.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.708
You suggest one, then.

02:24.583 --> 02:25.750
We'll stick to that.

02:25.833 --> 02:27.125
-Sure?
-Yes.

02:27.208 --> 02:28.291
Okay.

02:28.375 --> 02:29.416
Yeah.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.708
We need you to sign… here.

02:54.750 --> 02:55.875
Delia.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.500
-What's new?
-I'm fine…

03:00.500 --> 03:01.625
With my mother…

03:02.125 --> 03:04.083
What can I say? She's hanging in there.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.500
Is she awake?

03:07.041 --> 03:09.083
She's always awake at this time.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.333
Will you let us in?

03:28.083 --> 03:29.166
Well…

03:30.291 --> 03:31.375
Will you go?

03:33.958 --> 03:34.916
Go.

03:35.625 --> 03:36.791
I'll go with you.

03:40.208 --> 03:43.125
-Did you prepare the bag, as I asked?
-I'll get it for you.

03:49.750 --> 03:50.958
I'll wait outside.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.791
I'm ready.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.250
-Hello.
-Hello.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.916
Well… shall we?

04:26.916 --> 04:28.041
I already pressed.

04:28.666 --> 04:29.833
And this one?

04:33.458 --> 04:35.791
-Why all this fuzz?
-There it is.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.333
We won't fit.

04:42.416 --> 04:46.000
-We will, Mom.
-No, it's up to 600 pounds.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.666
You must weigh 180.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.750
-Around that.
-And you?

04:50.833 --> 04:51.708
Mom…

04:51.791 --> 04:54.750
We have about 450 pounds already…

04:54.833 --> 04:56.708
You take the stairs.

04:56.791 --> 04:57.833
Right.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.208
-Ma'am?
-Take the stairs.

05:04.875 --> 05:08.583
-Where are you taking me?
-You know, Mom. Medical exams.

05:08.666 --> 05:11.458
-This late?
-It's for your own sake.

05:11.541 --> 05:12.791
-Is everything okay?
-Yes!

05:12.875 --> 05:15.166
-How are we doing?
-It's nothing…

05:23.666 --> 05:24.791
Are those my earrings?

05:24.875 --> 05:27.125
Yes. You gave them to me
a long time ago, Mom.

05:28.041 --> 05:31.208
When you were little,
if you lied or misbehaved,

05:31.291 --> 05:32.833
I would pull your ears.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.125
Please! "It's for your own sake!"

05:35.208 --> 05:38.000
-"For your own sake!"
-What are you saying, you idiot?

05:38.083 --> 05:40.958
What are you saying? What are you saying?

05:41.041 --> 05:42.875
-"It's for your own sake!"
-Shut up!

05:43.625 --> 05:46.250
Let go off me, Mom! Let go!

05:46.333 --> 05:48.166
Tell me the truth!

05:48.250 --> 05:50.291
-It hurts!
-Tell me the truth!

05:50.375 --> 05:52.500
-Calm, now.
-And this one?

05:53.166 --> 05:54.125
What…?

05:55.333 --> 05:58.541
That's it, slowly now.
Come here. Sit down.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.416
I wasn't expecting this.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.625
It's so you calm down.

06:03.708 --> 06:06.541
-What is it, darling?
-Calm, now.

06:06.625 --> 06:07.958
It's for your own sake.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.458
Let's go, it's done. It's okay.

06:12.541 --> 06:15.083
Daniel, what did you tell them?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.625
Nothing, ma'am.

06:16.708 --> 06:21.125
Tell Delia that… the steaks…

06:21.208 --> 06:23.041
go in the freezer!

06:46.666 --> 06:49.291
We're here. This way…

06:50.291 --> 06:51.333
A bit more…

06:51.416 --> 06:53.458
Slowly…

06:53.541 --> 06:55.500
Slowly.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.708
That's it.

07:02.666 --> 07:05.208
What is this? Where are we?

07:06.041 --> 07:07.875
You can rest here.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.291
I'm not spending a single night here.

07:27.333 --> 07:32.291
27 NIGHTS

07:33.250 --> 07:34.333
Good morning.

07:58.041 --> 07:59.625
-Casares.
-Hello.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.583
This is the new assistant.

08:01.666 --> 08:04.708
Mr. Casares is the medical expert.
He must act ex-officio in case… Hoffman.

08:04.791 --> 08:06.333
Hoffman, that's right.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.791
-Leandro Casares.
-Alejandra Conde.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.875
Well, introductions made.
What should you do with the expert?

08:12.666 --> 08:13.916
Coffee, with sugar?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.375
-Yes.
-No. I can do it.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.125
-Want one?
-No, thanks.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.291
-What do you do, Alejandra?
-"I take…"

08:20.375 --> 08:22.291
I take his oath.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.666
The acceptance of the appointment.
And then?

08:24.750 --> 08:28.250
I hand him the file,
insofar as the expert requires it.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.250
-Perfect.
-Perfect.

08:29.333 --> 08:34.625
Yes, in fact, I'd rather first…
Well, first, have a coffee.

08:34.708 --> 08:38.291
And then have a more personal approach
to the case at hand,

08:38.375 --> 08:41.041
and only then check against the file.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.916
Counselor Bologna. Casares came
to take his oath for the Hoffman case.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.875
That's why I'm here. How are you?

08:46.958 --> 08:48.666
-Do you have a minute?
-Sure.

08:52.208 --> 08:53.208
Judge Bologna is…

08:53.291 --> 08:54.916
Don't drag it out.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.500
Your expenses are covered for a week.
If delayed, it's on you.

08:58.583 --> 08:59.583
Well, that's new.

08:59.666 --> 09:02.375
-Yes. I need the report in a week.
-That's difficult.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.833
It's a typical case of insanity.

09:04.916 --> 09:06.083
Two weeks, tops.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.791
Is she crazy or not? Straightforward.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.333
-She either has a screw loose or not.
-Right.

09:12.666 --> 09:13.750
Look.

09:15.250 --> 09:20.041
I want to assign
more cases to you, but, lately…

09:20.958 --> 09:24.958
Yes, I noticed that lately,
the raffles do not favor me much.

09:25.041 --> 09:25.916
Right?

09:26.625 --> 09:30.000
It's that… you take your time.

09:31.125 --> 09:37.375
An 83-year-old woman,
diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.875
Well, her daughters claim
that this woman was a partygoer.

09:40.958 --> 09:44.458
She had many lovers of dubious intentions,
so on and so forth.

09:44.541 --> 09:49.125
She was squandering the family fortune
in quite murky investments.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.625
Until she was admitted.

09:50.708 --> 09:54.583
After 27 days,
she manages to leave the clinic.

09:54.666 --> 09:57.833
And her house becomes a nightclub again.

09:58.750 --> 10:02.500
Her daughters, worried about their mother,
ask for her return to the clinic.

10:02.583 --> 10:04.458
I think it makes sense.

10:04.541 --> 10:07.958
-Well, we're venturing into…
-Into what?

10:09.708 --> 10:12.250
Well. I prefer to have my own…

10:12.333 --> 10:14.250
Oh, yes, your questionnaire, all that.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.375
She's 83 years old.

10:16.458 --> 10:18.500
The clock is ticking.

10:22.791 --> 10:25.000
Excuse me.
I am the court expert to see Mrs--

10:25.083 --> 10:27.000
Mrs. Martha. Top floor.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.125
Thanks.

10:34.291 --> 10:36.083
-Come in.
-Thanks.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.541
Hello.

11:46.625 --> 11:47.916
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.041
Grab that one.

11:56.416 --> 12:00.250
I'm sorry. She can't see you today.
She's not prepared.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.583
-Oh, I can wait.
-Not today.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.125
Be patient with her.

12:07.416 --> 12:09.208
She was locked in for many nights.

12:11.458 --> 12:13.458
It will take her some time to recover.

12:14.291 --> 12:16.666
-You're a lawyer, right?
-No.

12:17.166 --> 12:20.833
-Well, but you came to interrogate her.
-No, I'm here to interview her.

12:20.916 --> 12:21.833
I'm the court expert.

12:21.916 --> 12:23.333
-We're done.
-Okay.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.125
And whose side are you on?

12:28.291 --> 12:31.666
No, I'm not a party-appointed expert.
I was sent by the court.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.583
-I'm impartial.
-You are impartial. Does that even exist?

12:35.833 --> 12:36.666
I try.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.375
Bernardo Girves.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.666
Leandro Casares.

12:42.291 --> 12:43.625
I'll walk you out, sir.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.500
Do you know who Martha Hoffman is?

12:47.250 --> 12:50.916
No, I told you. I'm not a journalist,
nor a detective. I'm an expert.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.166
I met Martha when she widowed.

12:53.250 --> 12:56.000
She came to the gallery where I worked.

12:56.750 --> 13:02.166
I offered her some landscapes, you know,
paintings for the general public.

13:02.875 --> 13:06.791
She looked at me over her glasses
and said, "Do you think I'm stupid?"

13:07.625 --> 13:10.125
She lived in Paris in the '50s.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.375
In an apartment smaller than this hall.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.250
She'd go to André Gide's ex's to get food.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.833
Martha used to dance from dusk till dawn.

13:18.916 --> 13:20.750
She went to an audition once.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.541
She and 300 other girls.

13:23.791 --> 13:27.166
Only two were preselected.
Martha and some German girl.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.500
It took them a week
to choose between them.

13:31.166 --> 13:32.666
But Germans always win.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.166
And this was no exception.

13:35.791 --> 13:38.333
-Do you know who that German girl was?
-No.

13:38.958 --> 13:40.208
Pina Bausch.

13:40.791 --> 13:43.125
Pina Bausch.
Don't you know who Pina Bausch is?

13:43.208 --> 13:44.500
-I don't think so.
-Hold this.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.375
This wonderful dancer.

13:46.916 --> 13:49.041
Usually, this story is shocking.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.791
But not in this case, apparently.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.750
Martha was broke, and she was great.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.500
She certainly knew about art.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.083
-Careful.
-She was always great.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.458
Wish I had half the energy
the old woman has.

13:59.541 --> 14:00.375
It's unreal.

14:00.458 --> 14:03.083
Then she married Hoffman,
and they build an empire.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.500
But deep down,
Martha was still that dancer.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.416
Then she widowed.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.875
And she was reborn,
reincarnated in that Bohemian woman.

14:11.958 --> 14:14.708
-But now she's loaded.
-That's why they locked her in.

14:14.791 --> 14:16.666
They envy the old woman's freedom.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.041
What's your opinion?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.583
Well, I don't have an opinion.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.333
-Look who's here.
-I'm sure you must have an opinion.

14:24.416 --> 14:25.375
It was like that…

14:25.458 --> 14:27.041
No. Not for the time being.

14:27.125 --> 14:29.583
You get going. We'll get the car.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.166
See you outside.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.125
Wait.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.416
I'm sorry. Even if my mother
gave it to you, it's mine.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.791
Please, Daniel, take this upstairs.

14:41.875 --> 14:44.083
Yes. I am Leandro Casares.

14:44.166 --> 14:47.500
I was sent by the court
for Martha Hoffman's case,

14:47.583 --> 14:49.208
who is probably your… mother.

14:49.291 --> 14:53.250
-I apologize. You're the expert--
-You did it on purpose, Myriam.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.291
That's foul play.

14:55.791 --> 14:58.250
Do you think I have nothing to do, Mom?

14:58.333 --> 15:01.791
You send people over to my place
at times when you know I'm not up.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.333
The court sent him.

15:03.416 --> 15:05.791
I don't know when you're up. It's 11:00.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.583
-Excuse me, I--
-Is he the young man they appointed?

15:09.125 --> 15:10.875
Yes. I'm Leandro Casares.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.875
Come close to the screen.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.541
-Okay.
-What do you think, Delia?

15:17.041 --> 15:19.083
-He looks like a priest.
-Yes.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.583
Come back Monday, please.

15:20.666 --> 15:21.500
Sure.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.583
Like a sexy priest.

15:22.666 --> 15:23.541
Casares, is it?

15:23.625 --> 15:25.791
-Do you have a minute?
-Sure.

15:27.833 --> 15:31.583
Since she left the clinic, her friends
are back all over her like flies.

15:31.666 --> 15:33.958
-Yes, I met one of them.
-Girves, he's a bad person.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.041
He's been after my mother for ten years.

15:36.125 --> 15:39.083
I bet he told you
that delusional Pina Bausch story.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.708
-He did.
-Yes, he did.

15:40.791 --> 15:42.833
Pina Bausch
did not live in Paris in the '50s.

15:42.916 --> 15:45.375
Look it up, it's all on the Internet.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.583
Yes, but I insist, that's not what I do.

15:50.458 --> 15:55.000
This is a Patek Philippe from 1937.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.750
Do you know what this is?

15:56.833 --> 15:58.125
No.

15:58.208 --> 16:03.291
The delivery boy from the store
next to my mother's had it.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.458
She gave it to him.

16:13.625 --> 16:14.458
Eat.

16:15.625 --> 16:16.458
Okay.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.916
Turns out he had been in jail for fraud.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.750
He told my mother he was a dancer
with some European company.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.458
I gave him $500 and got it back.

16:29.041 --> 16:29.875
The watch.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.750
I got the watch back.

16:32.833 --> 16:37.458
Over the last few years, my mother
lost the notion of the value of things.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.583
Well, what can I say?

16:47.666 --> 16:52.083
My sister and I tried everything
before admitting her.

16:53.250 --> 16:57.083
When you say "admitting her,"
what do you mean?

16:57.666 --> 17:02.541
That is a decision
that should be made by a professional.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.125
Precisely.

17:04.208 --> 17:06.000
That's what I mean.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.041
My mother is a very intelligent woman.

17:09.125 --> 17:12.250
It was hard for us to see she was lost.

17:12.958 --> 17:15.875
It's very painful
to accept that deterioration.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.458
And now she escaped the clinic.

17:19.958 --> 17:22.125
But she needs to be cared for

17:22.208 --> 17:26.500
and protected by people
who really care about her.

17:30.583 --> 17:35.541
My mother was seeing someone
35 years younger than her.

17:36.416 --> 17:38.000
They were planning to marry.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.583
Another hustler.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.208
They took good care of her at the clinic.
It was easier for everyone.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.750
A Dalí is missing at my mother's.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.041
Do you know what a Dalí is?

17:51.125 --> 17:52.958
Yes, yes. I am familiar with Dalí.

17:54.708 --> 17:57.333
Well, a Dalí is missing.

18:00.083 --> 18:03.666
Valued at a considerable amount.

18:09.875 --> 18:11.625
Could you describe for me

18:11.708 --> 18:15.708
the most notorious changes
in your mother during recent times?

18:16.875 --> 18:20.833
Well, it's more or less
what I just told you. Right?

18:21.916 --> 18:23.083
Yes, yes, yes.

18:23.166 --> 18:26.000
Also, I'm sure you've read
Dr. Narvaja's reports.

18:26.916 --> 18:30.458
He's one of the most prestigious
neuropsychiatrists in the country.

18:30.541 --> 18:32.625
He's the one who had her admitted.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.708
What are you up to?

18:39.791 --> 18:40.875
Working.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.000
And what are you doing later?

18:44.125 --> 18:45.916
I have to work.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Tell me.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.333
At this time, you could relax a little.

18:52.416 --> 18:54.166
Go out, catch a movie.

18:54.708 --> 18:58.000
Yes, yes, sure. Some other time.
Some other time, Dad.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.750
Any problem that I can help solve?

19:00.833 --> 19:04.750
No, you can't help.
It's just this odd case.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.125
You can do that tomorrow.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.208
It's okay, Dad. Some other time.

19:08.291 --> 19:13.250
It's just that it would be good for you
to go out from time to time.

19:13.333 --> 19:17.666
As long as we're sharing this place,
we could take turns.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.875
So, do you need…?

19:21.958 --> 19:23.500
I have a date.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.791
Okay.

19:30.166 --> 19:33.208
-Yes. Do you want me to leave now?
-Yes.

19:33.750 --> 19:34.833
Okay.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.000
Here, at this hour?

19:42.083 --> 19:44.333
Yes. I got held up doing things.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.541
Oh, right.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.041
I'll have a coffee, then leave.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.000
Okay.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.625
-Do you need anything?
-No, not at this hour.

19:51.708 --> 19:55.291
-I came to study Martha Hoffman's file.
-I glanced over it.

19:55.375 --> 19:56.458
Did you?

19:56.541 --> 19:58.583
-Did you notice scans are missing?
-Scans are missing.

19:58.666 --> 19:59.583
Yeah.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.083
I found it odd.

20:03.708 --> 20:04.666
Right.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.166
Do you want to ask the neuropsychiatrist
who ordered the admission?

20:10.208 --> 20:13.291
Actually, there's no such thing
as a neuropsychiatrist.

20:14.208 --> 20:20.041
Doctor Narvaja is both a neurologist
and a psychiatrist at the same time.

20:20.708 --> 20:21.958
Right.

20:22.041 --> 20:25.958
Well, do you want to ask him
about the grounds for the admission?

20:51.958 --> 20:54.333
Wake up, Martha. It is already 11:00.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.916
Good morning.

21:02.666 --> 21:04.750
I shouldn't be in here.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.833
Narvaja prescribed these.

21:15.458 --> 21:17.375
-Who?
-Be nice, okay?

21:18.250 --> 21:20.750
Sure, I like pills.

21:26.708 --> 21:30.416
Now you're going to eat something,
then you'll meet your sector friends.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.416
What?

21:32.041 --> 21:35.125
The new pals with whom
you'll be sharing the experience.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.083
And later, we have the optional workshops.

21:38.666 --> 21:39.583
I opt not to go.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.083
Woke up feeling
a bit rebellious today, didn't we?

21:43.166 --> 21:44.875
I need to make a call.

21:44.958 --> 21:47.083
Do you want to talk
to one of your daughters?

21:47.583 --> 21:49.875
My captors? No, thanks.

21:49.958 --> 21:51.250
I understand, honey.

21:51.333 --> 21:55.791
But Dr. Narvaja
did not authorize any other calls.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.458
Should we get ready, Martha darling?

21:58.958 --> 22:01.375
Why do you talk to me
like I'm a little girl?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.833
Sorry, I didn't realize
I was talking to you like that.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.833
The problem for them
is the cultural difference.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.416
-Right.
-Sure…

22:16.500 --> 22:18.958
-They have everything…
-Do you need anything?

22:19.041 --> 22:21.000
Go back to your room, ma'am.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.250
Martha.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.250
Ma'am.

23:16.750 --> 23:17.833
Hello.

23:17.916 --> 23:18.958
Ma'am?

23:22.666 --> 23:23.833
Ma'am.

23:31.208 --> 23:32.416
Martha.

23:32.916 --> 23:34.166
Ma'am.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.791
Excuse me.

23:50.041 --> 23:51.416
Excuse me, Mr. Julio.

23:53.333 --> 23:54.666
Come on, Martha.

23:55.291 --> 23:58.000
Thanks for the warm company.

24:00.541 --> 24:03.291
My name is Archie.
They used to call me Ariel.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.791
Here, they call me Archie.

24:04.875 --> 24:08.000
Want to tell us something
that happened to you lately?

24:08.583 --> 24:11.083
-The sparrow thing?
-Again?

24:11.958 --> 24:13.958
-The sparrow thing, yes.
-Yes.

24:14.458 --> 24:17.250
There's this sparrow that…

24:17.333 --> 24:20.458
There's a nest by the window,

24:21.208 --> 24:23.000
and a sparrow is born.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.750
And then they took out the nest.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.958
-And you didn't like that.
-No.

24:31.333 --> 24:34.708
-No.
-Well, you can go on later.

24:35.208 --> 24:38.333
Anyone else who wants
to introduce themselves to Martha? Isabel?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.041
It's me.

24:40.791 --> 24:42.833
I am 46 years old.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.541
I turned 46 in here.

24:45.375 --> 24:47.041
I arrived six months ago.

24:47.750 --> 24:52.166
I'm bipolar and… I was having
anxiety attacks, but I'm better now.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.750
Yes, Isa, much better.

24:55.625 --> 24:58.291
But as we always say,
you're not just bipolar, right?

24:59.125 --> 25:01.541
You are teacher, for example.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.333
Geography teacher.
Sophomore and junior, high school.

25:04.416 --> 25:05.541
Great.

25:06.125 --> 25:07.208
Julio?

25:08.625 --> 25:11.125
Want to tell us something
that happened to you lately?

25:11.208 --> 25:13.833
Julio sometimes wants to express himself,
and sometimes he doesn't.

25:13.916 --> 25:15.458
Julio hears voices.

25:15.541 --> 25:17.958
What do they tell you? Tell us.

25:18.041 --> 25:19.416
He hears voices.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.250
Rafa, shall we sit?

25:21.333 --> 25:25.041
Come on, Rafa, leave him alone.
He will share when he feels like it.

25:27.416 --> 25:28.458
Okay, Martha.

25:29.750 --> 25:31.333
Tell us a little about you.

25:33.750 --> 25:35.625
I shouldn't be in here.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.000
They locked me unfairly.

25:38.083 --> 25:39.666
It's an understandable feeling.

25:39.750 --> 25:42.166
Sometimes we feel
the world does not understand us.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.958
The world understands me perfectly.

25:45.041 --> 25:48.958
Or it did,
until my daughters decided to lock me up.

25:49.041 --> 25:50.458
I understand.

25:50.541 --> 25:51.833
No, you don't.

25:53.583 --> 25:54.708
Well.

25:54.791 --> 25:56.333
Want to tell us more?

25:56.416 --> 25:58.708
Why do you think they locked you in?

25:59.208 --> 26:01.500
They are afraid I get married, I suppose.

26:01.583 --> 26:02.416
Great.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.041
Well done, Martha.

26:04.541 --> 26:08.000
Thanks for sharing,
for expressing yourself.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.125
You'll tell us more later on, okay?

26:18.333 --> 26:20.125
-Hello.
-Name?

26:20.208 --> 26:21.708
Leandro Casares.

26:22.333 --> 26:24.000
Leandro…

26:27.708 --> 26:29.875
Casares.

26:32.916 --> 26:34.833
Leandro Casares enters.

26:35.916 --> 26:38.708
-Leandro Casares, come in.
-Thank you.

26:42.291 --> 26:44.750
Take a seat. She'll be right here.

26:44.833 --> 26:45.916
Thank you.

27:08.666 --> 27:11.500
Are you the one going
to lock me back in that nut house?

27:11.583 --> 27:13.916
No. I'm the expert.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.708
I can't lock anyone.

27:17.541 --> 27:19.000
Take off your coat.

27:20.666 --> 27:21.708
Okay.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.583
Do you have microphones on?

27:27.666 --> 27:30.250
No, no, I don't.

27:31.375 --> 27:34.666
Tell me the truth.
Don't make me ask you to strip.

27:34.750 --> 27:38.125
No. If I wanted to record
our conversation, I'd ask.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.166
My home has been bugged.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.083
Is that so?

27:42.166 --> 27:46.166
And everything we say here
can be used against me or you.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.291
Who'd want to plant a bug here?

27:49.375 --> 27:50.458
My daughters.

27:52.875 --> 27:55.625
They don't let me leave my house.
I can't have any visitors.

27:55.708 --> 28:00.000
There are those guards
camping out there in the hall.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.750
It seems I'm very dangerous.

28:03.833 --> 28:06.291
Well, we'll assess that. Shall we?

28:06.375 --> 28:07.875
What side are you on?

28:08.583 --> 28:13.041
I'm sent by the court to write
an expert report. I am impartial.

28:13.125 --> 28:17.125
If I invited you to my room
and gave you a suitcase full of money,

28:17.208 --> 28:20.375
would you still be impartial?

28:20.458 --> 28:24.583
If you made that proposal,
I'd have to report you to the court.

28:24.666 --> 28:29.541
But with that money,
you could open your own detective agency.

28:31.375 --> 28:32.958
Are you serious?

28:33.875 --> 28:35.750
It seems to me that you are tepid.

28:37.291 --> 28:40.416
When you say tepid… Is it warmth you…?

28:40.500 --> 28:42.625
I propose we get naked.

28:44.958 --> 28:47.833
You got nervous. Don't be so literal, kid.

28:47.916 --> 28:49.916
Let's take off our masks.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.541
Let's start over.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.416
Let's take 30 seconds

28:54.500 --> 28:59.666
to breathe and relax in silence.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.000
Well, let's see…

29:13.625 --> 29:16.250
It hasn't been 30 seconds.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.333
Okay, now.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.416
More relaxed.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.125
Well, shall we start
with the questionnaire?

29:39.666 --> 29:43.416
I am tired of interrogations
and psychiatric questions.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.750
Speak normally.

29:45.833 --> 29:49.416
I know you've had
a hard time at the clinic.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.833
How would you describe it?

29:52.041 --> 29:53.666
And again, another question.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.833
Well, I don't know…
What should we talk about?

29:57.666 --> 29:59.333
You're a question machine.

29:59.916 --> 30:04.583
You're the only visit I'm allowed,
and I can tell it's not going to be fun.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.458
Delia.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.500
I'm not sure it's appropriate…

30:15.625 --> 30:17.166
Oh, you mean the micro…

30:20.625 --> 30:23.375
Young man, pour me some tea, will you?

30:25.666 --> 30:28.875
No, no. From the glass pot, the other one.

30:31.250 --> 30:33.708
And pour yourself a tea, too.

30:35.583 --> 30:40.916
"In your situation,
would you rather disappear? Be dead?"

30:41.000 --> 30:43.625
You can't read the questions beforehand.

30:43.708 --> 30:44.750
I prefer to be alive.

30:45.666 --> 30:46.500
Okay.

30:46.583 --> 30:47.625
And you?

30:49.666 --> 30:54.250
Me too, yes. I prefer to be
in this situation… like, alive.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.250
And what do you do to be alive?

30:57.791 --> 30:59.625
Sorry? No. I'm not following you.

30:59.708 --> 31:03.625
What other things do you do in life
apart from acting as an expert?

31:03.708 --> 31:07.791
Oh, well. I have hobbies. I play sports.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.500
You don't play sports.

31:09.583 --> 31:11.958
True. But I should.

31:12.625 --> 31:15.291
Do you have any patients,
besides your expert reports?

31:16.083 --> 31:17.875
-A few.
-Do you have a wife? Kids?

31:17.958 --> 31:18.791
No.

31:19.666 --> 31:21.833
-Girlfriend? Boyfriend?
-Girlfriend.

31:21.916 --> 31:24.208
No, not at the moment, but…

31:24.291 --> 31:26.833
-But you did before.
-Yes, yes. I did, before.

31:26.916 --> 31:28.000
And what happened?

31:28.083 --> 31:30.041
Well… we ended it.

31:30.125 --> 31:31.458
She dumped you.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.791
Yes, yes. She left me.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.416
Does it still hurt?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.083
Sometimes.

31:39.666 --> 31:42.916
Unbutton that top button.
You look like a priest.

31:45.291 --> 31:46.250
Alright.

31:49.083 --> 31:51.083
-Like that?
-Yeah.

31:51.625 --> 31:54.625
When was the last time
you had sexual intercourse?

31:55.125 --> 31:58.166
No, I'm not going to answer that.
Let's go on with the questions.

31:58.250 --> 32:03.333
I bet that, at my age,
I've had sex more recently than you.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.250
It is likely.

32:05.333 --> 32:08.625
Some of the symptoms are
sexual disinhibition,

32:08.708 --> 32:13.375
inappropriate social behavior,
loss of empathy, lack of judgment,

32:13.458 --> 32:15.708
compulsive behaviors,

32:15.791 --> 32:20.541
laughing… or crying unpredictably.

32:21.750 --> 32:25.416
Right now,
you might be diagnosing yourselves.

32:25.500 --> 32:30.708
Thinking to yourselves,
"But, Narvaja, I have those symptoms."

32:32.000 --> 32:33.125
Don't worry.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.875
It's very hard to identify
a pathology for such behaviors,

32:36.958 --> 32:39.625
which, to a certain extent,
are very familiar, right?

32:39.708 --> 32:42.041
I recognized those symptoms in my father.

32:42.708 --> 32:46.000
And so, I studied
frontotemporal dementia here,

32:46.083 --> 32:47.583
in this university.

32:48.500 --> 32:52.375
Then I specialized in neuropsychiatry
and did my PhD at Milton Wynants,

32:52.458 --> 32:55.083
trying to make my humble contribution
through my studies,

32:55.166 --> 32:57.458
to elucidate this topic worldwide.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.041
I'd like to ask for a round of applause
for my mentor, the great Héctor Seregni.

33:04.166 --> 33:05.250
Thank you.

33:06.041 --> 33:07.541
Thank you, guys.

33:08.041 --> 33:09.000
Thank you.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.250
Fede, hit the lights, please.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.500
This pen means a lot to me.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.583
I used it every day at Wynants.

33:20.666 --> 33:25.458
With it, I took my first notes on Pick's,
frontotemporal dementia.

33:26.125 --> 33:28.875
It's now a present for you,
you crazy old man.

33:29.958 --> 33:31.291
Thanks.

33:32.125 --> 33:33.458
She must return to the clinic.

33:33.541 --> 33:36.041
It's the best clinic in Argentina
to treat her condition.

33:36.625 --> 33:42.208
Yes. Anyway, I wonder why Martha Hoffman
was cut off during hospitalization.

33:42.791 --> 33:45.791
I appreciate your interest
beyond the official report.

33:45.875 --> 33:47.166
We had to isolate her.

33:47.250 --> 33:50.000
Her entourage was taking advantage of her,
of her vulnerability.

33:50.083 --> 33:53.958
You will notice Mrs. Hoffman's tendency
to part with her valuables.

33:54.041 --> 33:54.875
Her valuables?

33:54.958 --> 33:57.250
Her money, basically.

33:57.333 --> 34:00.916
Prodigality is one of the main symptoms
of frontotemporal dementia.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.208
So if Martha Hoffman
weren't a wealthy person,

34:04.291 --> 34:06.500
it wouldn't have been necessary
to institutionalize her?

34:06.583 --> 34:08.333
It would have been less urgent.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.708
It probably wouldn't have been necessary.

34:13.458 --> 34:15.833
I was called by a desperate family.

34:16.541 --> 34:19.750
Her daughters were afraid
of losing touch with their mother.

34:19.833 --> 34:23.625
Her behaviors exposed her to real dangers.
You must have noticed, right?

34:24.458 --> 34:27.750
Her institutionalization
was a precautionary and urgent measure

34:27.833 --> 34:30.666
to contain a situation
that was out of control.

34:33.041 --> 34:36.666
It gave us time
to continue deepening our studies.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.041
Now she's back home

34:38.125 --> 34:40.958
and as long as the report isn't concluded,
without a ruling,

34:41.041 --> 34:46.333
without therapy or treatment,
time can be against us.

34:47.666 --> 34:48.583
Allow me.

34:49.875 --> 34:54.458
The CT scans backing her diagnosis
were not attached to the file.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.208
-They weren't?
-No.

34:56.791 --> 34:57.791
That's strange.

34:58.416 --> 35:01.791
It will be hard to find them now,
as I am changing offices.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.541
But maybe in a few weeks.

35:04.125 --> 35:07.458
The case should be closed in a few weeks.

35:07.541 --> 35:10.041
And time can be against us.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.666
I'll see what I can do.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.583
Leandro Casares. I was here the other day.

35:31.458 --> 35:33.666
"Leandro Casares."

35:33.750 --> 35:35.500
-The expert.
-Casares.

35:37.333 --> 35:38.375
Excuse me.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.458
Have you heard someone speaking
without anyone being there?

35:45.625 --> 35:50.083
Well, sometimes I think
I hear my husband, Ernesto, snoring.

35:50.166 --> 35:53.416
But I understand perfectly
that he is not there.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.916
How much is a bag of tomatoes?

35:58.666 --> 36:02.833
Well, that question is unfair.
I haven't done the shopping in a while.

36:02.916 --> 36:04.125
Don't worry.

36:04.208 --> 36:05.333
Delia knows.

36:05.416 --> 36:06.958
-Yes, that's fine.
-Okay.

36:07.041 --> 36:11.958
Look, if you asked me
about the price of books,

36:12.041 --> 36:17.375
or what movies I saw lately,
I can tell you everything.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.416
I remember the plot and everything.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.500
Don't worry.

36:23.333 --> 36:28.375
You think you can classify people
through questions and answers.

36:28.458 --> 36:31.583
When you say "you", who do you mean?

36:32.458 --> 36:34.583
Lawyers, experts, psychiatrists.

36:34.666 --> 36:35.708
Right.

36:36.208 --> 36:39.583
But I know you can see
beyond that notebook.

36:39.666 --> 36:42.958
-Try.
-Well, we have our own methods.

36:43.041 --> 36:45.208
I imagine you on a first date,

36:45.291 --> 36:48.000
taking out your notebook
with the questionnaire.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.166
No, no. In that case I wouldn't…

36:50.250 --> 36:54.333
Tell me, if you want to kiss someone
for the first time, what do you do?

36:54.416 --> 36:57.375
Do you interrogate her
to see if you can kiss her?

36:57.458 --> 36:59.250
No, not in that case, no.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.541
In that case, well, yes.

37:02.041 --> 37:04.583
You could get slapped on the face.

37:06.666 --> 37:07.500
Well…

37:07.583 --> 37:09.458
You can't dance, can you?

37:09.541 --> 37:13.083
No, no. I can't dance, no.
I have no opportunity to, either.

37:13.166 --> 37:14.875
-I could…
-And I'm not…

37:14.958 --> 37:19.458
I'm not really interested in having
the opportunity, that's what I mean.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.333
I could teach you.

37:21.416 --> 37:22.708
On a future occasion.

37:22.791 --> 37:25.041
In the future, I'll be dead.

37:25.750 --> 37:26.666
Well.

37:27.750 --> 37:28.708
I'll keep going.

37:28.791 --> 37:31.333
I'll tell you three words.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.041
I want you to repeat them
as soon as I finish saying them

37:34.125 --> 37:36.833
to make sure
that you heard them right, okay?

37:37.708 --> 37:40.333
Bottle, hammer, stick.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.458
Those are three phallic elements.

38:09.125 --> 38:12.541
While you write
that very interesting fact down,

38:13.416 --> 38:15.791
I'll do a little exercise.

38:22.375 --> 38:25.375
I get the feeling that you…

38:25.458 --> 38:28.375
You're trying to delay
this evaluation a bit.

38:29.250 --> 38:30.250
Am I right?

38:31.500 --> 38:32.541
Yes.

38:33.666 --> 38:35.750
Yes, you may be right.

38:36.875 --> 38:41.625
Maybe I like this,
lingering in this moment,

38:41.708 --> 38:43.333
even if it's with you.

38:43.416 --> 38:45.750
To be locked in my house,

38:45.833 --> 38:48.500
in my own house, instead of a nuthouse.

38:50.208 --> 38:53.250
I have stuff to do, you know?
I have projects.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.625
You are an arts collector, aren't you?

38:56.708 --> 38:58.000
So it seems.

38:58.083 --> 39:02.500
Has it ever happened to you…
that a piece of yours got lost?

39:04.375 --> 39:06.666
They told you about the Dalí, didn't they?

39:06.750 --> 39:09.625
Let's see.
Tell me what happened with that piece.

39:09.708 --> 39:12.000
Maybe some of your friends took it.

39:12.083 --> 39:15.333
-No, my friends wouldn't steal it from me.
-I'm not saying they stole it.

39:15.416 --> 39:19.041
They may have simply helped you
take it out of your house and sell it

39:19.125 --> 39:22.208
without your daughters knowing,
since they control your money.

39:22.291 --> 39:25.708
Well, that's not a bad idea, but…

39:26.833 --> 39:27.666
But no.

39:27.750 --> 39:30.125
Unfortunately,
I don't know where that piece is.

39:30.208 --> 39:33.000
Right. Does it ever happen
that you can't control your behavior,

39:33.083 --> 39:36.125
or that you do something
without thinking and then regret it?

39:38.791 --> 39:41.375
Could you please ring the bell?

39:45.291 --> 39:46.208
Yes.

39:46.708 --> 39:51.666
Sometimes I do things I don't remember,
but I don't regret them.

39:52.291 --> 39:53.750
I try my best.

39:59.958 --> 40:03.708
She shouldn't take
that medication with alcohol.

40:07.083 --> 40:12.625
Yes, I understand about the microphones,
but I'm going to give you water, okay?

40:31.041 --> 40:32.041
Hello.

40:33.458 --> 40:35.625
-No visitors?
-No.

40:36.250 --> 40:37.333
Are you sure?

40:38.041 --> 40:38.958
Excuse me?

40:39.833 --> 40:41.625
I heard your story.

40:42.916 --> 40:45.333
I was also unfairly locked in.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.083
Do tell.

40:51.250 --> 40:54.125
Here, you will never know
if they visit you or not.

40:54.208 --> 40:55.958
They don't tell you everything.

40:56.458 --> 40:58.125
I don't understand.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.083
-You know, the nurses?
-Yes.

41:03.083 --> 41:07.291
They're watching me,
because they know that I…

41:11.708 --> 41:14.125
-Let's go, Pablo.
-Yes, I'm going.

41:21.041 --> 41:23.833
Because I have information
that can get them in trouble.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.333
What kind of information?

41:27.500 --> 41:29.916
I'm constantly under surveillance.

41:33.458 --> 41:34.583
Who?

41:35.208 --> 41:36.666
That's the thing.

41:37.416 --> 41:38.333
They're agents.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.583
Intelligence agents.

41:43.666 --> 41:45.166
What are you doing here?

41:45.875 --> 41:47.000
Just chatting.

41:47.083 --> 41:50.500
Sure, but go to your rooms.
This is a transit area.

42:03.291 --> 42:05.125
Vane, it's late. That's enough.

42:05.208 --> 42:07.000
Your roommates need to rest.

42:07.083 --> 42:08.208
Enough.

42:09.416 --> 42:11.041
Come on, please come down.

42:11.125 --> 42:13.083
-Are you a dancer?
-Vane.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.208
Maybe.

42:14.291 --> 42:15.833
-Vane…
-Let her.

42:15.916 --> 42:17.666
Stay out of it, Martha.

42:17.750 --> 42:18.875
Vane…

42:18.958 --> 42:22.000
Aren't you always hammering
about us expressing ourselves? Let her.

42:22.083 --> 42:24.208
Each to their own business, okay?

42:24.291 --> 42:25.416
Vane, please.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.625
That's enough, Vane.

42:39.750 --> 42:41.791
Half an hour? How…?

42:41.875 --> 42:43.958
-At six…
-Hello.

42:44.041 --> 42:45.916
-Excuse me.
-Hello. How are you doing?

42:46.708 --> 42:50.416
I'm Martha, your son's comrade…

42:50.500 --> 42:53.000
-A patient, a colleague I don't…
-Don't worry.

42:53.083 --> 42:54.458
Her name is Martha.

42:54.541 --> 42:55.708
Yes, I know.

42:55.791 --> 42:57.500
Her name is Martha Hoffman.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.416
I need help. Can I tell you my case?

43:02.625 --> 43:05.416
It is not the best time, because…

43:06.375 --> 43:10.541
Now I only have
a brief moment to talk to my son…

43:10.625 --> 43:13.958
-But another time, sure…
-Martha.

43:14.041 --> 43:15.916
Don't bother them, please.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.416
-Some other day maybe…
-Thanks.

43:19.916 --> 43:21.250
Martha put on some makeup.

43:24.458 --> 43:25.791
She's coming this way.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.333
-Hello.
-Hello.

43:32.416 --> 43:33.625
I'm Martha.

43:34.333 --> 43:36.250
Yes, my dad told me about you.

43:37.416 --> 43:39.000
He doesn't speak to me.

43:39.750 --> 43:40.666
He has his ways.

43:41.958 --> 43:43.791
Look, I want to ask you for a favor.

43:43.875 --> 43:46.708
I need you to go to a cultural center.

43:46.791 --> 43:51.166
The one in the old oil mill,
behind the bridges.

43:51.250 --> 43:53.291
My friends are there.

43:53.375 --> 43:56.250
Tell them I've been cut off.

43:56.333 --> 43:57.541
Come on, Martha.

43:57.625 --> 43:59.083
Let's go that way. That's it.

44:01.375 --> 44:02.291
Let's go.

44:05.250 --> 44:07.708
-I'm Martha Hoffman.
-Enough, Martha.

44:08.291 --> 44:09.916
That's it, come with me.

44:14.666 --> 44:15.708
Martha.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.875
Vane, let's end the dancing.

44:24.958 --> 44:26.666
Martha, do you need anything?

44:26.750 --> 44:28.541
Call me if you do.

44:40.750 --> 44:41.833
Casares.

44:42.375 --> 44:43.833
I already called, Casares.

44:44.583 --> 44:46.666
Don't mix everything up!

44:48.833 --> 44:50.375
-Excuse me.
-Oh, Casares.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.500
I'm not sure it's a good time.

44:52.583 --> 44:54.083
Is that Casares?

44:54.583 --> 44:56.458
-Let him in.
-Excuse me.

44:58.625 --> 45:01.125
They want to make me sign this rubbish.

45:01.208 --> 45:03.000
Look, read. Read.

45:03.083 --> 45:04.708
Read and tell me what you think.

45:04.791 --> 45:07.333
Is it a good time to use the restroom?

45:07.416 --> 45:08.750
I can wait.

45:08.833 --> 45:11.333
From this proposal,
it would seem that I'm not so crazy.

45:11.416 --> 45:15.208
I can go out in exchange
for not using my money anymore.

45:15.291 --> 45:18.541
It's not like that, Mom.
We are talking about squandering.

45:18.625 --> 45:20.625
And who establishes what is squandering?

45:20.708 --> 45:26.625
Well, anyone would say that investing
such a large amount in a cultural project,

45:26.708 --> 45:28.833
which is a scam,
well, that is squandering.

45:28.916 --> 45:30.166
What scam?

45:30.250 --> 45:32.833
The building has been seized!

45:32.916 --> 45:35.458
There's a government lawsuit
for those lands.

45:35.541 --> 45:38.750
Ma'am, one of the men outside
is asking if he can come in…

45:38.833 --> 45:40.750
Now is not the time.

45:40.833 --> 45:43.458
-Yes. Excuse me. I'd better leave--
-Stay, Casares.

45:43.541 --> 45:46.708
Don't go, Casares.
There is no way to make her understand.

45:46.791 --> 45:49.375
You can't make me understand a thing, kid.

45:49.458 --> 45:50.583
True.

45:50.666 --> 45:52.958
Your friends do make you
understand things.

45:53.041 --> 45:55.291
They have good taste like you.

45:55.375 --> 45:57.416
So, they understand.

45:57.500 --> 45:59.875
That's why I sent my daughter
to study in Paris,

45:59.958 --> 46:02.083
at the school her grandmother recommended.

46:02.166 --> 46:04.458
Not to the one I prefer
because I don't have good taste.

46:04.541 --> 46:06.833
-I didn't say that.
-Yes, you did say it.

46:07.416 --> 46:08.625
Maybe.

46:09.458 --> 46:10.958
You don't have great taste.

46:11.833 --> 46:17.791
Well, this daughter with a lousy taste,
has dealt with your finances for years,

46:17.875 --> 46:21.583
making sure your tarot reader,
your lawyers, and your whole staff

46:21.666 --> 46:24.833
are paid in a timely fashion,
while you give the Dalí to your friends!

46:24.916 --> 46:29.833
She needs her doctor friends
to certify I'm crazy.

46:29.916 --> 46:33.250
To justify and to cover up
what you cannot admit.

46:33.333 --> 46:34.458
You know what that is?

46:34.541 --> 46:35.750
I won't go there.

46:35.833 --> 46:38.041
That your life is shit.

46:38.125 --> 46:40.208
That your husband is a piece of shit,

46:40.291 --> 46:43.250
that your job is shit,
and that your friends are shit.

46:44.416 --> 46:46.291
And I'm not a good mirror for that,

46:46.375 --> 46:48.875
because I'm surrounded
by beautiful things.

46:52.666 --> 46:53.916
I'm sorry.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.333
It's my father.

46:55.833 --> 46:58.791
Fortunately, my granddaughter
turned out better than you.

46:58.875 --> 47:03.708
So your mother and your daughter
are better than you, and you know it.

47:05.333 --> 47:07.166
You know what that's called?

47:09.291 --> 47:11.458
That's called "bad luck."

47:11.958 --> 47:14.208
The law will prove you are sick.

47:15.291 --> 47:18.833
Or that you are a motherfucking cunt.

47:18.916 --> 47:20.708
Take that. That's it.

47:21.666 --> 47:22.958
Take this with you!

47:23.041 --> 47:24.000
Take it!

47:24.083 --> 47:25.708
Enough, Martha. That's enough.

47:26.541 --> 47:27.541
You'd better just stop.

47:58.541 --> 48:01.625
-Do you need anything?
-No, no.

48:01.708 --> 48:03.208
I wanted to check in on you.

48:03.708 --> 48:04.791
Are you okay?

48:05.500 --> 48:06.875
Yes, thank you.

48:08.041 --> 48:10.625
Bottle. Hammer. Stick.

48:11.500 --> 48:12.333
What's that?

48:14.250 --> 48:16.833
Bottle. Hammer. Stick.

48:17.333 --> 48:18.500
Was it in that order?

48:19.875 --> 48:23.125
Yes, yes, don't…
Don't worry about the questionnaire now.

48:24.250 --> 48:26.708
I'll come back another time.
Do you need anything?

48:26.791 --> 48:28.833
Would you shut the door, please?

48:40.166 --> 48:41.375
Oh, you're here.

48:41.458 --> 48:44.208
You seemed so focused, sir,
I didn't want to bother you.

48:44.791 --> 48:46.333
You can call me by my first name!

48:48.166 --> 48:50.875
And at this time, you could go home.

48:50.958 --> 48:53.000
-I brought you some coffee.
-Thank you.

48:53.083 --> 48:57.541
It happens that power is out at home,
so I'd rather stay here a while longer.

48:58.833 --> 49:01.958
So, are you staying here at night?

49:02.791 --> 49:04.333
Well, no…

49:05.625 --> 49:06.958
Sometimes I stay, yes.

49:07.041 --> 49:08.500
A little longer.

49:08.583 --> 49:12.791
I'd take you in at home…
But today, my father has…

49:12.875 --> 49:15.416
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to…

49:15.500 --> 49:18.583
No, no, no.
I was just saying, just in case.

49:18.666 --> 49:20.333
Oh, no, no. Thank you.

49:23.708 --> 49:27.833
And what do you do
when you stay here at night?

49:27.916 --> 49:31.583
I review files, cases… or nothing.

49:33.333 --> 49:35.333
-Do you sleep here?
-No.

49:36.708 --> 49:37.541
Sometimes.

49:38.458 --> 49:40.083
But if you need to stay…

49:40.166 --> 49:41.958
No, no, not at all. I'm fine.

49:42.041 --> 49:45.083
-I mean, because of your father.
-No, we take turns with my father…

49:45.166 --> 49:47.250
If I'm out for a while, that's it…

49:49.833 --> 49:54.666
Sorry if I'm being blunt, sir,
but you should submit that report already.

49:56.083 --> 49:58.291
-You can call me by my first name.
-Okay.

49:58.916 --> 50:00.625
I mean, it's been over a week.

50:00.708 --> 50:02.916
Yeah. No, sure. You're right.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.458
It's true. Thanks.

50:04.541 --> 50:07.250
I've been looking at Narvaja's file.

50:07.333 --> 50:09.291
There's nothing about Rothman in it.

50:10.125 --> 50:11.083
Rothman?

50:11.166 --> 50:14.000
Rothman was Martha's psychiatrist
for the past years.

50:14.083 --> 50:18.000
And I don't know why
she wasn't the one to sign the diagnosis.

50:18.708 --> 50:20.791
So, the second signature, whose was it?

50:20.875 --> 50:22.958
Another psychiatrist's. Gloria Fusco.

50:27.875 --> 50:30.333
If she wants to question us,
we don't say a thing.

50:30.416 --> 50:31.458
Sure.

50:36.166 --> 50:39.333
You stay quiet for a few seconds.

50:39.416 --> 50:41.208
Don't look nervous.

50:41.291 --> 50:42.541
I won't say anything.

50:44.750 --> 50:48.250
We shouldn't make her feel pressured.
Let's not scare her.

50:48.333 --> 50:49.875
Yes, yes. Sure.

50:55.458 --> 50:56.750
Well, let's stop here.

51:00.291 --> 51:01.250
Come.

51:02.291 --> 51:06.083
-Thanks for seeing us, Doctor Fusco.
-I told you today wasn't the best day.

51:06.166 --> 51:08.375
-I know. It's a bit urgent.
-Tell me.

51:08.458 --> 51:12.666
It's about a certificate you signed,
which is included in a file.

51:12.750 --> 51:13.583
-Right?
-Yes.

51:13.666 --> 51:16.000
Well, I think we could…

51:16.083 --> 51:18.250
I'm sorry.
Martha Hoffman started a lawsuit

51:18.333 --> 51:21.458
against her daughters and Dr. Narvaja,
so sooner or later,

51:21.541 --> 51:24.250
your signature on her diagnosis
will be looked into.

51:24.333 --> 51:27.958
I have nothing against Mrs. Hoffman.
I don't even know her.

51:28.041 --> 51:31.791
So you signed a diagnosis
without meeting the patient personally?

51:31.875 --> 51:34.375
-I don't know how these things work.
-I'll explain.

51:34.458 --> 51:38.125
Dr. Narvaja submitted some studies,
and I concurred with his diagnosis.

51:38.208 --> 51:39.458
Nothing illegal.

51:39.541 --> 51:42.083
Sure, I imagine.
We have nothing against you.

51:42.166 --> 51:44.708
We just need
to understand the facts better

51:44.791 --> 51:47.375
because the studies submitted
were incomplete.

51:48.708 --> 51:51.000
This case was a particular one.

51:51.083 --> 51:57.083
Narvaja came to my place one afternoon
and said he needed a certificate.

51:57.166 --> 51:59.458
That he had scans
supporting his diagnosis.

51:59.541 --> 52:01.333
The scans missing in the file.

52:01.416 --> 52:02.666
But I saw them.

52:03.375 --> 52:06.250
He told me it was a delicate case.

52:07.083 --> 52:11.000
He needed a second signature
to back his diagnosis.

52:11.500 --> 52:12.375
So?

52:13.708 --> 52:14.750
So I signed.

52:15.916 --> 52:17.250
You just signed.

52:19.875 --> 52:22.875
Did he offer anything?
I mean, something in return?

52:23.583 --> 52:25.500
Are you a court expert or a detective?

52:26.083 --> 52:30.500
Maybe you felt pressured
because you worked for him?

52:31.041 --> 52:33.250
No, no. I was his right hand.

52:33.333 --> 52:34.166
Was?

52:34.250 --> 52:38.291
Well, he started his own project.
The new foundation.

52:38.375 --> 52:40.833
Which you are not part of.

52:40.916 --> 52:41.875
I'm not.

52:42.666 --> 52:45.416
Maybe you know too much about his tricks

52:45.500 --> 52:48.000
and you don't want to continue
being an accomplice?

52:48.916 --> 52:49.750
What tricks?

52:50.666 --> 52:53.458
For instance, where does the money
for the new foundation come from?

52:54.750 --> 52:56.875
I think you are fantasizing.

52:58.750 --> 52:59.625
I'm sorry…

53:00.583 --> 53:04.666
That pen,
is it from the university Narvaja went to?

53:05.625 --> 53:07.000
Oh, yes.

53:07.958 --> 53:09.500
He gave it to me.

53:11.125 --> 53:12.166
Look.

53:12.250 --> 53:14.750
There was nothing irregular
in the procedure.

53:14.833 --> 53:18.083
Nor do I think Narvaja is hiding anything.

53:18.166 --> 53:21.416
But tell me what you need
and I'll see if I can help.

53:21.500 --> 53:25.041
We would need to access the lost scans.

53:25.583 --> 53:27.458
-Right?
-Yes.

53:28.041 --> 53:32.541
I tried to hold his hand,
because it was colder than usual.

53:33.083 --> 53:36.333
I was afraid he would die right there.

53:36.833 --> 53:39.125
The doctors weren't very clear.

53:39.208 --> 53:41.208
They didn't tell us much.

53:42.625 --> 53:45.333
My daughters got angry at me.

53:45.875 --> 53:48.666
They said I was hiding information.

53:48.750 --> 53:51.375
Myriam said I kept things from them.

53:51.458 --> 53:52.458
And you?

53:54.083 --> 53:55.750
What did you feel?

53:55.833 --> 53:57.958
I wanted to send them to hell.

53:58.041 --> 53:59.916
-Both of them?
-Yes.

54:01.500 --> 54:03.041
Myriam, more so…

54:03.125 --> 54:04.416
Your elder, right?

54:05.458 --> 54:09.958
Olga too, because she always hides
behind her sister.

54:10.875 --> 54:12.083
And then?

54:12.666 --> 54:15.708
Then, I told them to leave the room.

54:15.791 --> 54:19.375
That they were upsetting their father,
fighting with me like that.

54:20.375 --> 54:22.291
And they had no choice but to leave.

54:23.083 --> 54:24.875
But I saw when…

54:29.625 --> 54:32.083
When Myriam came out of the room…

54:33.333 --> 54:36.208
When Myriam left the room, she hesitated…

54:38.375 --> 54:42.666
whether to say goodbye to her father,
in case she didn't see him again.

54:45.958 --> 54:48.666
And I told her to leave, again.

54:50.250 --> 54:51.208
So?

54:51.833 --> 54:52.958
They never…

54:53.833 --> 54:55.708
They never saw him again.

54:58.500 --> 54:59.333
So…

55:01.916 --> 55:04.208
Martha, you have a visitor.

55:05.541 --> 55:07.833
-A suitor?
-Your daughter.

55:08.666 --> 55:09.666
Olga.

55:10.166 --> 55:12.041
-Shall I come with you?
-No.

55:12.916 --> 55:15.708
-I suggest you don't get into a fight.
-Let her do what she wants.

55:15.791 --> 55:17.208
Stay out of it, Vane.

55:36.583 --> 55:37.583
Wait.

55:39.958 --> 55:42.541
Come on, guys, get out of here.

55:44.375 --> 55:46.708
-Romi, that's enough…
-Yes.

55:47.416 --> 55:49.208
-Thanks for the help.
-It's just unbelievable.

55:49.291 --> 55:51.000
Sure, I understand. But that's it.

55:51.083 --> 55:52.458
Pablo, let's go.

56:02.500 --> 56:03.333
Mom.

56:12.083 --> 56:13.083
What is it?

56:14.750 --> 56:17.250
We tidied up the house, with Delia.

56:17.750 --> 56:21.083
I brought you some clothes
and some cosmetics--

56:21.166 --> 56:22.916
Don't set foot in my house.

56:28.041 --> 56:31.166
-Would you rather not have me visiting?
-Give me the cosmetics.

56:32.125 --> 56:34.000
I left them with the nurses.

56:34.083 --> 56:35.583
They won't let us…

56:36.541 --> 56:38.333
They have their protocols here.

56:38.416 --> 56:40.583
We'll talk when I'm out.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.416
I wanted to know how you were doing.

56:47.458 --> 56:48.833
Are they treating you well?

56:49.666 --> 56:51.833
You will regret this.

56:53.666 --> 56:57.416
Myriam doesn't know regret.

56:58.416 --> 56:59.875
But you…

57:06.416 --> 57:07.291
Well.

57:08.291 --> 57:10.125
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

57:11.625 --> 57:12.791
Why's that?

57:14.916 --> 57:17.083
Did you have much to do?

57:21.500 --> 57:23.166
Let me know if you need anything.

57:46.750 --> 57:47.583
Martha.

57:49.125 --> 57:50.166
How are you?

57:52.375 --> 57:53.291
Fine.

57:54.750 --> 57:58.750
I went to that place you said,
and met your friend, Girves.

57:59.416 --> 58:00.666
He sends this.

58:20.875 --> 58:23.541
-I don't have my glasses.
-Do you want me to read?

58:28.916 --> 58:30.875
Wait. I need mine, too.

58:30.958 --> 58:32.500
I'll read.

58:33.791 --> 58:34.958
Oh, alright.

58:41.500 --> 58:42.875
"Dear friend,

58:42.958 --> 58:46.541
what a joy to learn you still exist."

58:47.125 --> 58:51.666
"I came to think that you had been
part of a dream of mine."

58:51.750 --> 58:56.125
"And that I had to come to terms
with a sad wakefulness."

58:56.916 --> 59:00.416
"Thanks to the lady who gave you this,

59:00.500 --> 59:05.500
I learned your whereabouts
and tried to visit."

59:05.583 --> 59:07.458
"But they didn't let me in."

59:08.166 --> 59:10.750
"What a shame
that such good-looking people,

59:10.833 --> 59:15.458
in such sexy uniforms, are so strict."

59:19.125 --> 59:25.416
"Even Vera
posed as a lunatic to infiltrate,

59:25.500 --> 59:27.250
but was unsuccessful."

59:27.916 --> 59:33.750
"Apparently, the real crazy
are not believed to be so."

59:34.916 --> 59:36.000
Martha!

59:39.250 --> 59:41.916
-Does it go on?
-What are you doing there?

59:42.416 --> 59:44.791
"We'll find a way
to get you out of there."

59:45.375 --> 59:49.125
"And we will again
swim in a sea of dicks."

59:49.625 --> 59:51.000
"Yours, Girves."

59:51.083 --> 59:52.541
Shall we go?

59:54.791 --> 59:55.750
Let's go.

59:57.333 --> 01:00:00.166
Fist. Palm. Side. Fist. Palm. Side.

01:00:01.541 --> 01:00:04.333
Fist. Palm. Side. Fist…

01:00:04.416 --> 01:00:06.333
Fist. Palm. Side. Fist…

01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:07.708
It's okay.

01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:08.958
It's okay.

01:00:09.833 --> 01:00:12.708
Tell me, once and for all,
if I'm crazy or not.

01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:17.541
This last sequence wasn't so bad.

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:19.958
You remembered the page.

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:22.125
Hand on the head, the three steps…

01:00:22.208 --> 01:00:25.625
Well, it should have been the left hand,
but that isn't serious.

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:27.541
So, what do I have?

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.250
Well, basically, you have lived 83 years.

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:35.083
I could also get confused
between the left and the right.

01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:37.083
Let's not talk about politics.

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.000
That's right.

01:00:38.083 --> 01:00:41.416
I don't think that would be convenient.

01:00:41.958 --> 01:00:43.916
You're a leftist, am I right?

01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:48.500
Well, I don't know.
Let's say I'm apolitical.

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:53.208
Impartial, apolitical, asexual.

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:55.625
Delia.

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:04.708
Sorry, I'm afraid those pills
can be confusing and weakening you.

01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:07.458
They're prescribed
for people with dementia.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:09.791
Right now, nobody is treating you.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.250
But they help me sleep.

01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:14.708
-What if I stopped?
-Who knows.

01:01:14.791 --> 01:01:19.083
I understand, but it's not advisable
to take them without supervision.

01:01:24.125 --> 01:01:25.125
Thank you.

01:01:25.958 --> 01:01:27.500
Give me that.

01:01:35.833 --> 01:01:36.916
Alright.

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:40.958
If I couldn't have whiskey
because of the pill…

01:01:41.875 --> 01:01:43.833
now I can have whiskey.

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:49.458
You are the only visit
I'm allowed to have, you know?

01:01:49.541 --> 01:01:50.750
Yes, I'm aware.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:55.000
And I find you
quite prude and formal, but…

01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:00.083
it is what it is.

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:27.750
Casares, come here.

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:29.208
Come on, now!

01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:31.333
No, I told you I don't know how to move.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:37.000
Stillness is a form of movement,
as Pina Bausch said.

01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:39.500
-You know who she was?
-Yes, I did hear about her.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:40.958
Well, then.

01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:42.166
Come here.

01:02:53.333 --> 01:02:56.666
I'm sorry about the scene
you witnessed yesterday.

01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:59.958
All mothers are monsters.

01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:04.916
My mother was one,
I am one, and Myriam is one.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.291
And Olga, if she were a mother,
she'd also be one.

01:03:11.208 --> 01:03:12.750
Give me some shoulder.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.875
Just a little.

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.416
Don't think about dancing.

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:27.083
Think of something you like,
or someone you like.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.208
There! There's someone.

01:03:34.791 --> 01:03:35.750
A woman?

01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:38.000
Yes, maybe.

01:03:38.583 --> 01:03:42.083
I'm going to rip that button, Casares.
Unbutton it.

01:03:43.041 --> 01:03:45.708
You have to act, you have to leap forward.

01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:48.166
Otherwise, it will be too late.

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:50.708
Come here, I'll help you loosen up.

01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:52.500
-Here, on the ball.
No, no.

01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:53.791
-Yes…
-There's no need.

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:56.000
Get on it, go on.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:57.458
No fear.

01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:58.583
Ma'am!

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.541
-Excuse me.
-What do you want, sir?

01:04:04.625 --> 01:04:05.916
To use the restroom…

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.500
-Yes, it's over there.
-Thanks.

01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:12.166
Casares.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:16.291
-You want to use the restroom, too?
-No, I was just with my partner.

01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:19.625
Aren't you hungry? Come to the kitchen,
I'll fix you something.

01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:20.583
Okay.

01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:24.583
Come, Casares. Get your coat.

01:04:24.666 --> 01:04:26.958
-Where are you going?
-Come!

01:04:27.958 --> 01:04:30.250
If you're going out,
you need to let them know, don't you?

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:32.541
I did, don't worry.

01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:37.166
You were drinking.

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.875
Just a sip, that's all.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.083
When was the last time you drove?

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:43.000
I don't know.

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:46.208
Do you prefer to drive?

01:04:49.166 --> 01:04:52.708
Martha, have you thought about
negotiating with your daughters?

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:57.541
No.

01:05:23.458 --> 01:05:24.416
Hello.

01:05:26.458 --> 01:05:27.791
Martha!

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.666
The queen of the brothel!

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:33.375
Martha!

01:05:33.875 --> 01:05:35.166
Martha is here.

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:37.416
Martha has arrived!

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.666
Martha is here!

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:43.291
She is so sexy!

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:48.166
Casares, don't you get lost!

01:05:49.125 --> 01:05:53.666
STAY STRONG, BROTHERS

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:56.916
Hello.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.708
-Hello.
-Hello!

01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:03.708
What's the piece about?

01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:08.000
What is it about for you?

01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:11.041
That…

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.291
No, I don't know.

01:07:15.541 --> 01:07:18.625
This one… looks subrealist, right?

01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:20.500
Could be.

01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:22.291
Could be…

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:24.875
Dalí?

01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:31.708
I mean, it could be a Dalí.

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:35.500
Could be…

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:37.000
You got me there.

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:44.500
Excuse me.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:00.000
Martha!

01:08:02.875 --> 01:08:03.958
I'm sorry.

01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:14.750
Article eight says, "The admitted person…"

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:33.875
-You are the… the…
-What are you up to?

01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:36.291
-You are Martha's friend…
-Martha?

01:08:36.375 --> 01:08:37.416
Yes, I lost her.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.250
-Do you know where…
-Do you want to join us?

01:08:39.333 --> 01:08:40.666
-Come on!
-No, I'm fine.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.625
I'm fine being still. Thank you.

01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:45.708
Well, stillness is a form of movement.

01:08:46.583 --> 01:08:51.375
-Yes, Pina Bausch said that, right?
-No, no. Isadora Duncan did, right?

01:08:52.583 --> 01:08:54.458
-No, I'm fine!
-No, come on, hey!

01:08:54.541 --> 01:08:55.583
No. Give me that.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.375
Give it to me.

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:10.041
Be careful!

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:13.375
Careful, he's the expert!

01:09:13.458 --> 01:09:15.166
Use your hands.

01:09:15.666 --> 01:09:16.958
Yeah, well done.

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:18.916
Loosen up.

01:09:45.458 --> 01:09:47.833
Thank you.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.875
-Want some?
-Thank you.

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:02.833
What's with those hips?

01:10:05.458 --> 01:10:07.166
You need to grease those shafts.

01:10:08.916 --> 01:10:10.750
Take this. It will be good for you.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.083
What is it?

01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:15.791
A love drug, very nice, very smooth.

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:17.416
Yes, but, what is it?

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.000
A love drug.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:23.083
Well, if I'm going to take it,
I prefer you tell me what it is.

01:10:23.916 --> 01:10:25.208
Thank you.

01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:28.333
-Don't take it if you don't want to.
-No, it's okay. I'll take one.

01:10:29.833 --> 01:10:30.833
Thanks.

01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:36.666
No, I'm saying precisely the opposite.

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:40.083
What I am saying is to reduce the matter
to whether Martha is crazy or not,

01:10:40.166 --> 01:10:45.833
is to degrade her existence to a diagnosis
that might be corrupted by your morality.

01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:47.208
Maybe what you're trying to do

01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:50.208
is to lock her up
because she's old and a bit of a slut.

01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:51.583
No, I don't want to lock her up.

01:10:51.666 --> 01:10:54.250
Well, what's the problem?
Can't someone be old and a little slutty?

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.750
-No, of course not.
-One can't?

01:10:55.833 --> 01:10:58.208
-No! Yes, one can. Yes.
-It's allowed.

01:10:58.291 --> 01:11:01.958
-The opposite idea.
-I understand, yes.

01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:10.875
If you turned it upside down,
that's what you'd get.

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:12.916
-Yes, yes.
-Yeah.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.166
And in what capacity are you here today?

01:11:16.791 --> 01:11:17.625
Sorry?

01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:21.250
He's asking why you're here.

01:11:21.333 --> 01:11:24.708
If you came as a companion,
investigator or expert?

01:11:24.791 --> 01:11:26.875
No, I didn't come as an investigator.

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:28.666
But now that you mention it…

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:33.791
Do you know a Dalí is missing
from Martha's house?

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:37.500
I mention this
because maybe you know something.

01:11:37.583 --> 01:11:40.458
Because you spent
a lot of time there, right?

01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:43.333
Look, if I had to steal anything
from Martha's house,

01:11:43.416 --> 01:11:45.166
I wouldn't steal the Dalí, darling.

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:46.291
Right!

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:49.875
-I'd steal a Foglino.
-I'd steal the Verges Rilla collection.

01:11:49.958 --> 01:11:53.375
But of course,
a Dalí does not thrill me at all.

01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:57.125
Martha is not a poor little old woman.

01:11:57.208 --> 01:11:59.125
Rich people are made for that anyway.

01:11:59.708 --> 01:12:01.666
-What do you mean?
-Rich people, I mean.

01:12:02.333 --> 01:12:04.208
I mean the trickle-down effect…

01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:06.791
When money piles up, it's like water.

01:12:06.875 --> 01:12:09.625
There's a certain amount
of water on Earth, which circulates.

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:11.875
It evaporates, it condenses.

01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:15.416
When money piles up,
that capital is taken out of circulation.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.375
It's like water that stagnates, rots.

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:18.833
How nice.

01:12:20.541 --> 01:12:21.666
Have a seat.

01:12:23.958 --> 01:12:29.166
When a lot of money is invested in art,
that money evaporates, okay?

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:33.083
But it creates dark clouds
that bring rain, which fall to the rivers,

01:12:33.166 --> 01:12:36.166
which overflow into other rivers and seas,

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.583
which create more condensation and steam.

01:12:38.666 --> 01:12:40.083
And that's it, it's a cycle.

01:12:41.416 --> 01:12:46.166
Money trickled down into arts,
is a drizzle of justice, just barely.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:51.541
And at the end of that cycle,
all that money returns to the same few.

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:54.333
-And it's great that Martha is among them.
-It's great.

01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:56.750
Because she does create
a virtuous cycle with that money.

01:12:57.375 --> 01:13:00.583
Art creates dark clouds, you see?

01:13:00.666 --> 01:13:04.333
If they do not fix these roofs
as soon as possible,

01:13:04.416 --> 01:13:07.166
the rain caused by those dark clouds

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:11.666
threaten the works of art.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.500
Art, my love.

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:14.750
Art.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:21.500
-And what would be the role of the State?
-To regulate that cycle and those rivers.

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:23.708
As a hydro dam.

01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:26.625
-Even if Martha isn't aware.
-What?

01:13:29.833 --> 01:13:34.041
No, even if Martha
isn't aware… of all this.

01:13:35.958 --> 01:13:37.291
Martha is aware of everything.

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:41.208
-That's why she's here with us.
-Are you sweating a lot?

01:13:43.416 --> 01:13:44.958
Yes, I think so.

01:13:46.791 --> 01:13:47.625
Are you okay?

01:13:48.416 --> 01:13:49.250
Yes.

01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:53.708
Excuse me.

01:14:07.166 --> 01:14:14.083
LIFE IS STRONGER THAN THIS

01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:17.250
Casares.

01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:19.291
-Where were you?
-Martha.

01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:21.500
No, I was looking for you. Yes.

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:24.083
I took something. I think…

01:14:24.166 --> 01:14:26.041
I don't feel very well.

01:14:26.125 --> 01:14:28.500
I did tell you not to give him anything.

01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:29.625
Sorry.

01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:31.708
And it must be quite strong.

01:14:31.791 --> 01:14:33.083
You're sweating heavily.

01:14:33.166 --> 01:14:35.875
But quite strong… do you know its effects?

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:37.708
I don't take those things, Casares.

01:14:37.791 --> 01:14:40.666
I'm over 80. Do you want me to die?

01:14:41.208 --> 01:14:43.500
What… can I die?

01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:44.875
I don't think so, no.

01:14:45.375 --> 01:14:48.083
I feel I'm short of breath, or…

01:14:48.166 --> 01:14:50.000
Come, come.

01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:53.416
As if…

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.958
Martha!

01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:56.708
Hi, Gaby.

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:02.208
-Juan!
-I…

01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:03.125
Juan!

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:07.416
I should… drink some water…

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.833
Go ahead.

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:11.208
How are you? Again?

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:15.500
You, carrying this again! Put it down.

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:20.208
-Take this off.
-Why don't you leave this?

01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:22.916
-Yes, but where…
-Here.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:23.958
There, there.

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:26.291
I'll leave it there, and when you go…

01:15:26.375 --> 01:15:27.291
No, but…

01:15:27.375 --> 01:15:30.541
…I'll give it back.
Let's swap shirts, want to?

01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:32.541
I'll wear yours, and you, mine.

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:34.041
It will look great on you.

01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:38.250
Come with me.

01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:40.458
This is sorted.

01:15:52.541 --> 01:15:55.041
What's this?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Yeah?

01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:30.791
One second.

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:33.041
Son!

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:36.458
There's a woman asking for you.

01:17:42.416 --> 01:17:45.125
I'm Martha's youngest daughter. Hoffman.

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:47.208
-Can I come in?
-Yes, yes…

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:01.750
Hungover?

01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:03.166
What? No…

01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:11.125
Are you okay?

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:12.625
Yes, yes, yes.

01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:15.500
Tell me.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:20.958
Here is a sculpture… of great value.

01:18:22.166 --> 01:18:23.500
-Pina Bausch?
-Sorry?

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.458
-Dalí, I meant.
-Yes.

01:18:27.458 --> 01:18:29.125
Who had it?

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:30.500
I did.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:32.833
It was as a precaution.

01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:37.750
My mother was giving away some valuables,
and this is the most valuable one.

01:18:37.833 --> 01:18:39.458
You can understand.

01:18:39.541 --> 01:18:40.708
My sister doesn't know.

01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:44.500
So I would like to ask you
to be discreet. She…

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:46.416
My sister is…

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.041
She's special.

01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:53.125
I didn't tell her at the time,
so… no need for her to find out now.

01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:56.458
That's beyond the scope
of my role as an expert.

01:18:58.083 --> 01:19:00.666
It wouldn't be the only thing
beyond the scope of your role.

01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:04.291
My mother returned home this morning.

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:09.208
And what makes you think that I…?

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:12.750
Delia called, worried.
So, I went there and got up to speed.

01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:18.041
Pour yourself some.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.958
-Do you want some?
-No.

01:19:32.041 --> 01:19:34.458
What I'm asking for
is that you go to my mother's

01:19:34.541 --> 01:19:37.791
and put this piece in its place.
No comments.

01:19:38.791 --> 01:19:40.125
They say you are reliable.

01:19:43.416 --> 01:19:44.458
Believe me.

01:19:45.541 --> 01:19:47.208
It's what's best for us all.

01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:06.791
Excuse me. We need to go elsewhere.

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:08.333
Tell me, where to?

01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:11.125
Turn here. We're going to the Court.

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:21.416
Hey. I got the scans.

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.125
The scans. Great.

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:25.458
You'll tell me all about it.
You're awesome.

01:20:27.333 --> 01:20:28.333
Excuse me.

01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:31.166
You went shopping?

01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:33.333
Yes.

01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:43.375
They found the old lady wandering
about the city, totally lost, at dawn.

01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:47.250
What a… disaster.

01:20:52.291 --> 01:20:56.083
Are you suggesting
I had anything to do with it?

01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:07.833
Graciela!

01:21:09.958 --> 01:21:12.041
Graciela went out for a moment.

01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:14.708
-Help me activate this.
-Sure.

01:21:24.333 --> 01:21:26.458
-…to the restroom, too?
-No, I was just with my partner.

01:21:26.541 --> 01:21:27.750
Thank you, kid.

01:21:27.833 --> 01:21:31.750
Come to the kitchen,
I'll fix you something.

01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:35.833
Come, Casares. Get your coat.

01:21:36.416 --> 01:21:38.666
-Where are you going?
-Come!

01:21:39.833 --> 01:21:42.250
If you're going out,
you need to let them know, don't you?

01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:43.583
I did. Don't worry.

01:21:43.666 --> 01:21:45.916
Yes. Is that recording legal?

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:49.375
That's a different matter, Casares.
We'll discuss it later.

01:21:49.458 --> 01:21:50.583
Let's end this.

01:21:51.458 --> 01:21:53.166
Yes, I…

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:55.791
I have…

01:21:55.875 --> 01:21:59.208
Look, I made some progress
with the report…

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:01.291
No… it's not ready, it's not ready.

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:03.916
-It's, it's…
-Does it say it, or not?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.250
What?

01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:07.583
Does she have a screw loose?

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:11.416
No, precisely, that's where I'm at.
That's the thing.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.416
-I need…
-I need you to finish that report, now.

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:15.708
Sign it.

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:22.416
Bring it before she has another episode,
and we have a bigger problem.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.375
-This pen…?
-What?

01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:27.708
-It's from Wynants University.
-Oh, right?

01:22:27.791 --> 01:22:29.666
Go figure. Come on, speed it up.

01:22:30.916 --> 01:22:32.250
Did someone give it to you?

01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:34.458
What do I know? What do you care?

01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:37.750
I am investigating.
I need to collect evidence.

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:40.416
Either you sign or you resign, Casares.

01:22:41.625 --> 01:22:43.375
And that's it for investigating.

01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:46.958
I need that report signed.

01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:52.875
Yes. It's my father.

01:22:52.958 --> 01:22:55.083
It's an emergency.

01:22:55.166 --> 01:22:58.500
I'll be back and sort it out, okay?

01:23:01.666 --> 01:23:03.291
You're overcomplicating it, Casares.

01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:12.583
-Thanks.
-Did it work?

01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:14.708
Yes, yes. I told him it was my father.

01:23:14.791 --> 01:23:17.166
Oh, great. Rothman is waiting.

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:18.583
Martha's psychiatrist?

01:23:20.791 --> 01:23:23.708
I took Bologna's pen.
He had the same as Narvaja.

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:25.791
From Wynants University.

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:29.083
Yes, but I think they sell it
pretty much everywhere.

01:23:29.166 --> 01:23:31.166
I think I even have one.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I find that strange.

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:35.958
This atrophy in the frontal lobe

01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:41.291
can alter Martha's memory and judgment.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.958
But it could also be the product
of her old age, of course.

01:23:46.041 --> 01:23:49.625
So… the evidence isn't conclusive?

01:23:49.708 --> 01:23:50.833
Evidence?

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:54.208
I don't know, you sound like a detective.

01:23:55.541 --> 01:23:58.083
I mean that these scans

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:01.208
don't show a case
of frontotemporal dementia.

01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:04.125
Well, that's a realm for debate.

01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:06.041
Sure, but, what do you believe?

01:24:07.166 --> 01:24:08.541
Well, unlike her daughters,

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:11.916
I believe Martha
always had an eccentric behavior.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.750
And eccentricity
is not a symptom of dementia.

01:24:14.833 --> 01:24:16.583
Right, precisely what I meant.

01:24:16.666 --> 01:24:19.291
No. It seems to me
that you have taken a stand.

01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:21.541
You want me to tell you
that Martha is healthy?

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:26.208
What I can tell you is that these studies
don't seem conclusive enough

01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:28.708
to diagnose frontotemporal dementia.

01:24:28.791 --> 01:24:31.791
Well, if the studies aren't conclusive,

01:24:31.875 --> 01:24:34.375
your report is going to be decisive.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500
-Yes.
-How long was she your patient?

01:24:39.583 --> 01:24:42.208
-Well, over ten years.
-And you never saw her again?

01:24:42.291 --> 01:24:44.958
No. When her daughters came to see me

01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:47.875
asking me to sign her admission,
and I refused,

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:50.375
I lost all contact with Martha.

01:24:50.458 --> 01:24:51.458
Right.

01:24:51.541 --> 01:24:54.875
If it comes to that,
would you be willing to testify?

01:24:54.958 --> 01:24:56.041
Yes, sure, of course.

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:59.458
But if you could spare me the process,
I'd appreciate it.

01:25:00.625 --> 01:25:01.791
Thank you.

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:05.416
See you.

01:25:10.916 --> 01:25:12.375
Well, great then.

01:25:12.458 --> 01:25:14.625
I think now I'm almost done.

01:25:15.916 --> 01:25:17.125
"Almost"?

01:25:18.541 --> 01:25:21.333
You should submit the report already,
shouldn't you?

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:24.208
Yes, yes, I'm ready. I'm ready.

01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:27.833
You were very helpful.

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.375
Thank you.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.083
You surprised me.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.541
I hope I get more cases with you.

01:25:43.666 --> 01:25:44.583
Can I kiss you?

01:25:44.666 --> 01:25:45.791
Excuse me?

01:25:46.833 --> 01:25:47.791
No!

01:25:48.291 --> 01:25:49.125
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

01:25:49.208 --> 01:25:50.625
No, no, I'm sorry…

01:25:50.708 --> 01:25:52.625
-Can you?
-Yes, yes, yes.

01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:55.125
I'm sorry.

01:25:55.208 --> 01:25:56.916
I'm terribly sorry, uh, excuse me.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.833
I think I misunderstood.

01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:01.375
I'm so sorry… I thought…
I thought that was the vibe.

01:26:01.458 --> 01:26:05.208
-No, maybe I led you to…
-No, you didn't lead me to anything.

01:26:05.291 --> 01:26:09.708
-It's just that I'm dating someone.
-You don't have to explain. No.

01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:13.666
Well, sir, but I think you're interesting.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.958
-You can call me by my first name.
-Okay.

01:26:16.458 --> 01:26:20.000
Well, these past days
we formalized that relationship and…

01:26:20.083 --> 01:26:21.000
Right.

01:26:23.333 --> 01:26:24.500
I'm late.

01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:36.125
You surprised me, sir.

01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:38.250
You surprised me, Leandro.

01:26:38.333 --> 01:26:39.958
No, I didn't think…

01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:42.208
Yes, I'm not the spontaneous type.

01:26:42.875 --> 01:26:46.166
Well, if you were
to interrupt that relationship…

01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:48.083
Yes, but not for now.

01:27:03.375 --> 01:27:04.583
Name?

01:27:04.666 --> 01:27:06.666
-Leandro Casares.
-Leandro Casares.

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:09.708
You can't go in.

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:12.000
-What?
-I'm sorry, you're not on the list.

01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:14.333
Sure?

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:17.500
-Strange. Well, I'll talk to Delia…
-I'm sorry, that won't be possible.

01:27:17.583 --> 01:27:19.791
Yes. I want to see how the lady's doing.
But you're new.

01:27:19.875 --> 01:27:22.250
-Do you have permission for this?
-We were sent by the court.

01:27:23.583 --> 01:27:25.083
-Hi, Delia.
-Hi.

01:27:25.166 --> 01:27:28.541
I need to speak to Martha.
They won't let me in.

01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:31.666
-Could you tell her I was here?
-Sir, please. Can you leave?

01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:34.583
-Tell her I have enough evidence.
-Sir.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.416
-Please, sir.
-Yes.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.625
I am the expert. I'm evaluating the Mrs.
I haven't finished my work.

01:27:39.708 --> 01:27:42.416
I don't know what the issue is,
but give me one second.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:46.291
Hand her this, please.
Tell her it wasn't stolen after all.

01:27:46.375 --> 01:27:47.208
Careful.

01:27:47.291 --> 01:27:49.541
Yes, I know. I'm aware of some of it.

01:27:49.625 --> 01:27:53.041
Yes, that, well… I guess it can be glued.

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:54.000
Now, sir.

01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:55.791
It's time now, sir. Please.

01:27:55.875 --> 01:27:57.208
Yes, yes, I'm done.

01:27:57.291 --> 01:28:00.833
And tell her she was right.
They have a microphone.

01:28:00.916 --> 01:28:02.291
-Okay?
-Sir, you need to leave…

01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:03.583
Casares!

01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:06.208
Relax.

01:28:07.125 --> 01:28:09.458
Relax, Casares. I'm fine.

01:28:10.875 --> 01:28:12.500
Now, sir.

01:28:12.583 --> 01:28:15.041
That's it. Yes, I'm okay, that's fine.

01:28:15.125 --> 01:28:17.416
-That's it.
-Goodbye, Casares.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.666
Moving along.

01:28:33.833 --> 01:28:35.875
You can't sleep either.

01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:37.625
No.

01:28:51.625 --> 01:28:55.625
Law number 22,914.

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:58.125
Article six says,

01:28:58.208 --> 01:29:01.958
"All admissions
will be immediately informed

01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:06.000
by the director of the institution
to the relatives of the patient

01:29:06.083 --> 01:29:08.166
or other appointed individuals."

01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:09.916
How many are they?

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.250
Article 8 says…

01:29:12.833 --> 01:29:14.500
How many are they?

01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:17.500
It's just a few of them,
blocking the road.

01:29:17.583 --> 01:29:19.791
I need someone to come
and give me a hand, please.

01:29:19.875 --> 01:29:22.791
I'll be right there.
Wait for me, I'm coming.

01:29:22.875 --> 01:29:23.958
I'm coming.

01:29:24.041 --> 01:29:25.375
I'll come with you.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.666
Article 13 states,

01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:50.416
"Non-compliance
with the duties that this law imposes

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:54.708
on the managing directors
of healthcare establishments,

01:29:54.791 --> 01:29:57.166
will be brought
to the attention of the authorities

01:29:57.250 --> 01:29:59.458
responsible for guaranteeing the exercise…

01:30:00.041 --> 01:30:01.958
I'll let you know so you can cover for me.

01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:05.708
"And, in this case,
of the relevant criminal

01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:08.583
and correctional judicial authority."

01:30:08.666 --> 01:30:11.083
Come on, come on.
Please. You can't be here.

01:30:11.166 --> 01:30:13.250
Bring the institute's director.

01:30:13.333 --> 01:30:15.250
There are patients here, please…

01:30:15.333 --> 01:30:17.750
-We are recording everything.
-Tell me your name.

01:30:17.833 --> 01:30:19.583
You've been warned!

01:30:19.666 --> 01:30:21.916
Free Martha Hoffman!

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.250
If she's not released within 24 hours,
these images will flood the press.

01:30:28.333 --> 01:30:29.875
You've been warned.

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:32.791
Who are they?

01:30:36.041 --> 01:30:37.458
My friends.

01:30:42.166 --> 01:30:43.666
Your friends know too much.

01:30:45.625 --> 01:30:48.375
-They should be careful.
-Go back to your rooms, please.

01:30:56.041 --> 01:30:57.583
Shall I walk with you?

01:30:57.666 --> 01:30:59.583
Release Martha!

01:30:59.666 --> 01:31:00.791
NEUBA
PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:14.416
There you go. Do you want a mirror?

01:31:15.125 --> 01:31:17.541
I'm 83 years old. Speak normally.

01:31:17.625 --> 01:31:20.916
Yes, forgive me. I'll bring you a mirror.

01:31:22.916 --> 01:31:24.416
How does it look?

01:31:25.875 --> 01:31:26.916
I don't know.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.041
-How?
-It's fine.

01:31:30.333 --> 01:31:31.833
Excuse me, Martha.

01:31:33.375 --> 01:31:35.125
She must be in room 15.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Yes, and I think she's with Julio.

01:31:43.958 --> 01:31:46.916
Relationships of this type
between patients are not allowed.

01:31:48.833 --> 01:31:50.208
Don't worry.

01:31:50.291 --> 01:31:52.000
Pack your things.

01:31:52.083 --> 01:31:53.708
We are releasing you.

01:32:18.416 --> 01:32:19.875
-This is for you.
-No, don't, Martha.

01:32:19.958 --> 01:32:22.583
Yes, yes. It suits you.

01:32:23.291 --> 01:32:24.125
There.

01:32:24.208 --> 01:32:26.291
For Vane…

01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:30.000
-Since she's a dancer.
-Sure, I'll give it to her.

01:32:31.083 --> 01:32:32.041
Bye, girl.

01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:35.958
Hi, love!

01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:38.125
-How are you?
-Let's go.

01:32:38.208 --> 01:32:39.791
A few words, Martha.

01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:44.083
Are you ready?

01:32:54.666 --> 01:32:57.458
Hanging dicks amidst pricks.

01:32:57.541 --> 01:33:01.500
Balls lurking. Cocks rolled inside briefs.

01:33:01.583 --> 01:33:04.916
Wangs! Tools! Schlongs like cement.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.875
Cowboys with just one ball.

01:33:06.958 --> 01:33:09.583
Dicks from the locker rooms,
shaken with joy.

01:33:09.666 --> 01:33:12.833
Urinals, Uranus. Black pudding.

01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:18.041
Punctured condoms,
862 dick per square feet.

01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:22.291
Flaccid Mormon weenies,
and millions of willies.

01:33:22.375 --> 01:33:23.916
Cocks and more cocks.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.750
A scented bouquet of thick Black knobs.

01:33:32.875 --> 01:33:34.125
Bye, girl.

01:33:35.166 --> 01:33:37.041
Get some rest.

01:33:37.541 --> 01:33:38.708
Hello.

01:33:44.083 --> 01:33:47.000
-Ma'am.
-Would you let my daughters know I'm back?

01:33:47.708 --> 01:33:48.958
Who's there?

01:33:49.041 --> 01:33:52.500
Delia, you can come down. We are here.

01:33:55.458 --> 01:33:57.125
Are you alright, ma'am?

01:34:00.125 --> 01:34:02.166
You could give me a hug, huh?

01:34:11.791 --> 01:34:14.250
-We're here.
-Yes, ma'am.

01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:23.541
Your thing is beeping.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.208
Kiddo…

01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:42.000
"2:00 p.m. Court. Hearing.
Confirm receipt."

01:34:45.916 --> 01:34:48.208
You're out of the case.

01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:57.166
It's 'cause you take too long.

01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:03.791
We're late, Mom.
What did you want to tell us?

01:35:03.875 --> 01:35:06.041
What's the condition?

01:35:06.125 --> 01:35:07.291
Yeah, right.

01:35:07.375 --> 01:35:11.375
You must apologize
for the 27 nights I spent locked in.

01:35:14.791 --> 01:35:16.083
Look, Mom…

01:35:16.166 --> 01:35:18.208
I just want to hear that.

01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:23.083
I'm sorry, Mom, if things…

01:35:23.166 --> 01:35:26.583
I'd rather hear only that.

01:35:26.666 --> 01:35:31.166
For you to simply say you're sorry.
Without any arguments or excuses.

01:35:34.333 --> 01:35:36.375
Come on, Olga, you can do it.

01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:41.458
I'm sorry.

01:35:43.916 --> 01:35:45.041
Myriam?

01:35:46.958 --> 01:35:48.416
Whatever you say, Mom.

01:35:48.958 --> 01:35:50.041
What? I don't…

01:35:50.125 --> 01:35:51.291
I didn't get it.

01:35:51.375 --> 01:35:52.458
That.

01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:54.458
What?

01:35:54.541 --> 01:35:56.083
Forgive us.

01:35:56.583 --> 01:35:58.666
Speak for yourself, she already did.

01:35:58.750 --> 01:36:00.000
Stop it.

01:36:00.083 --> 01:36:01.625
Alright. Deal's off, then.

01:36:01.708 --> 01:36:03.333
I'm sorry!

01:36:06.458 --> 01:36:10.625
I can only organize the files
in alphabetical order, you know?

01:36:10.708 --> 01:36:11.958
-Hello, Casares.
-Hello.

01:36:12.041 --> 01:36:14.416
They're waiting for you
in the hearing room.

01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:17.750
We'll deal with your suspension later.

01:36:20.333 --> 01:36:21.166
Good luck.

01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:22.833
Thanks.

01:36:24.416 --> 01:36:26.458
-All good?
-Yes.

01:36:28.125 --> 01:36:30.583
"The court proceeds
with this mediation hearing,

01:36:30.666 --> 01:36:32.583
agreed upon by the parties involved

01:36:32.666 --> 01:36:36.333
in the trial for the insanity
of Martha Hoffman,

01:36:36.416 --> 01:36:39.666
a case initiated
by Myriam and Olga Hoffman."

01:36:56.541 --> 01:37:01.083
"The expert report presented
by forensic expert Leandro Gabriel Casares

01:37:01.166 --> 01:37:05.083
will not be taken into account
by challenge of the defense itself,

01:37:05.166 --> 01:37:09.875
since his impartiality in the procedure
has been compromised."

01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:14.250
"As for the confirmation of the diagnosis
of frontotemporal dementia

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:16.583
established by Orlando Narvaja,

01:37:16.666 --> 01:37:20.041
it will be considered inconclusive,

01:37:20.125 --> 01:37:23.833
resulting in the mediation
by the parties."

"If the following agreement is signed,
Myriam Hoffman and Olga Hoffman

01:37:28.291 --> 01:37:31.333
agree to recuse their request
for Martha Hoffman

01:37:31.416 --> 01:37:33.125
to be admitted in an institution."

is unfit to be autonomous."

"Therefore, the following conditions
are established."

"From now on, Martha Hoffman won't be able
to sell or get a mortgage on her assets…"

Apologies.

01:37:52.125 --> 01:37:56.583
"She won't be able to buy new property,
establish companies nor sign agreements."

01:37:56.666 --> 01:37:59.250
"She will not marry
nor leave the country."

01:37:59.333 --> 01:38:01.166
"For any of the aforementioned conditions,

01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:05.250
Martha Hoffman will require
the conformity of her daughters

01:38:05.333 --> 01:38:07.791
or their appointed representatives."

01:38:09.583 --> 01:38:15.125
will be managed by a trustee
appointed by Mrs. Martha Hoffman

01:38:15.625 --> 01:38:17.625
in agreement with her daughters."

01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:20.583
Let's move to the trustee of my fortune.

01:38:20.666 --> 01:38:24.250
Yes. We agreed to appoint expert Casares.

01:38:24.791 --> 01:38:27.583
Well, as there are no objections,
and if Mr. Casares agrees,

01:38:27.666 --> 01:38:33.041
he is formally appointed
as the trustee of Mrs. Hoffman's fortune.

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:35.750
Casares?

01:38:35.833 --> 01:38:39.375
Yes. No.
I guess I don't have to decide right now.

01:38:44.375 --> 01:38:47.416
-Let's try with three months in advance…
-Three months?

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.791
-Martha.
-One second.

01:38:52.208 --> 01:38:53.375
What was that about?

01:38:54.083 --> 01:38:56.375
-Accept, Casares.
-Martha?

01:38:56.458 --> 01:38:59.375
-I'll steal him for a minute. Come.
-One second.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.708
How many patients do you have?

01:39:05.375 --> 01:39:06.333
A few.

01:39:07.083 --> 01:39:08.625
How many is a few?

01:39:09.666 --> 01:39:13.750
I have two. But one is… on and off.

01:39:19.833 --> 01:39:20.833
Martha!

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:31.000
What was that about?

01:39:32.333 --> 01:39:35.000
I negotiated, as you suggested.

01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:36.625
As I suggested?

01:39:37.916 --> 01:39:39.833
Yes, I believe so.

01:39:39.916 --> 01:39:46.166
I must warn you, Martha,
that I can't manage my house nor my life.

01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:48.083
It's not that complicated.

01:39:48.166 --> 01:39:52.291
All you have to do is report
every expenditure I wish to make.

01:39:52.375 --> 01:39:54.583
Yes. In any case…

01:39:55.125 --> 01:39:59.541
I'm not sure it's a very…
how can I put it? A stable job.

01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:02.000
But you'll have a good salary.

01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:06.041
Yes, yes. Thank you, but…
How can I explain?

01:40:06.125 --> 01:40:09.916
I don't know how long I'll have the job.

01:40:10.708 --> 01:40:15.500
Oh, right.
You mean that I can die any moment now.

01:40:15.583 --> 01:40:17.583
No, well, it's not that I say it.

01:40:17.666 --> 01:40:21.208
Let me tell you that I intend to live
for many years more.

01:40:21.291 --> 01:40:23.291
Yes, of course, no, me too.

01:40:23.375 --> 01:40:24.458
But you never know.

01:40:24.541 --> 01:40:29.833
You're right. A piano could fall
on our heads at any moment.

01:40:29.916 --> 01:40:32.708
But we will come up with a solution.

01:40:32.791 --> 01:40:38.083
Look, I have a sculpture
that I could give you as a collateral.

01:40:38.166 --> 01:40:42.791
It has one broken arm,
but it still has a lot of value.

01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:46.500
Let me walk you.

01:40:46.583 --> 01:40:48.833
-Forget it. I can do it.
-I know.

01:40:48.916 --> 01:40:51.958
It's just to show you off.

01:40:52.041 --> 01:40:53.041
Fine.

01:41:00.875 --> 01:41:02.958
Don't drag it, Casares.

01:41:03.666 --> 01:41:04.875
Okay.

01:42:00.666 --> 01:42:06.083
YEARS LATER,
ARGENTINA PASSED A NEW MENTAL HEALTH ACT.

01:42:06.875 --> 01:42:08.916
IT FORBIDS INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.083
AND GUARANTEES THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN IN CONTACT WITH LOVED ONES.

01:42:23.041 --> 01:42:25.541
MARTHA LIVED TO 104

01:42:25.625 --> 01:42:28.583
IN FULL POSSESSION OF HER FREEDOM.
