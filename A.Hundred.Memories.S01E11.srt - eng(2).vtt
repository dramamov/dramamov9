[Episode 11: Miss Korea]

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.060
Try this.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.480
A friend gave me this pu'er tea.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.390
It's a fermented tea which is good for you.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.040
The aroma is quite nice.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.910
Thank you.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.330
"Why did you call me here?"

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.620
"Don't beat around the bush and get to the point."

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.160
That's how you're looking at me. Am I wrong?

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.130
I have a client appointment coming up soon.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.710
Okay. I'll get to the point.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.250
Ko Yeong Rye.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.410
Let's cause a little trouble together.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.130
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.910
How about entering Miss Korea?

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.230
Sorry?

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.930
There is a candidate our shop has been supporting.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.110
But after 20 years of producing Miss Koreas,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.700
I feel something is missing.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.140
You could fill that gap.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.330
What do you think?

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.520
D-Director, it's something
I've never even dreamed of.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.590
Then, start thinking about it now.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.120
This weekend is the prelim application deadline.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.310
Compared to the girls
who are artificially polished,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.120
I think you're way more natural and fresh.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.180
Director, I-

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.400
In your interview, you said your dream
was to go to college, right?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.960
If you win the Miss Korea crown,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.320
you get 15 million won in scholarship.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.190
I heard you've been working

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.390
and squeezing in time to study for night school.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.140
But when will you get there?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.430
Isn't that motivation enough?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.490
I'm in favor.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.610
You wanted to attend college.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.370
If your financial situation is resolved,
you could focus on the exams.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.520
Even if you don't place,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.400
I think it'll be a good life experience.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.860
Taking on challenges is your specialty.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.730
Aren't you Ko Yeong Rye as in
"Go all in, no matter what"?

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.590
But still.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.420
This is too big a challenge.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.070
Me, Miss Korea? Not in my wildest dreams.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.020
Not in your wildest dreams?

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.390
Why not? What's the problem?

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.760
You're already Jin in my eyes.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.090
Come on. I'm being serious.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.110
All right. What about your mom?

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.790
Did you tell her yet?

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.260
No, not yet.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.320
My mom will probably flip.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.400
But should I still discuss it with her?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.650
I should, shouldn't I?

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.260
You must be tired. I told you to go up.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.830
Why the hell won't you listen?

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.560
I'm better off doing it alone.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.710
What? You've got something to say to me?

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.280
I'm telling you, you're psychic.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.930
If you started telling fortunes,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.820
every fortune teller in this town
would go out of business.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.700
Goodness. You're dragging this out too much.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.460
Cut the nonsense and spit it out.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.110
What is it?

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.990
So that missile or Mitchell, or whatever...

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.960
said you should try for Miss Korea?

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.590
Yeah.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.100
If I win the crown, I could win scholarship money.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.940
- Fifteen million won.
- F-Fifteen million won?

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.270
With that money, we could deal
with the increased rent

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.310
and cover living costs and tuition.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.560
Then, I could go all-in on entrance prep and...

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.500
And? Why are you trailing off?

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.790
If I don't make it...

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.590
But if I get to the main round and don't rank,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.480
I can't work during the training period,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.150
and I won't get paid.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.620
I'll have wasted time for nothing.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.150
Then, I can't help you
with living expenses, either.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.060
Don't worry about living expenses.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.350
How can I not?

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.590
I know you're barely keeping up with the rent.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.150
Still, don't worry this time.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.970
Don't worry about living expenses.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.410
If you want to do it, do it.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.490
If it doesn't work out, so be it.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:07.510
Do you know what I said to you
the most while raising you?

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.800
"Don't."

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.660
"Do it later."

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.470
Back then, I was killing myself
feeding five mouths.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.580
I needed you to chip in.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.030
Gosh, what can you do...

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.650
If you had studied with your brain,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.940
you'd already have made it big by now.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.200
When you were young, you were
busy yelling, "All right!"

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.290
And now, you're busy cutting other people's hair.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.750
For once, I wanted to tell you to go for it.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.480
You're at an age when you'd want
to do so many things.

00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:04.300
Why are you getting all sentimental
all of a sudden, Mom?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.650
Because that's how I feel, you brat.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.630
So go for it.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.530
Miss Korea or whatever.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.910
I'm going to back you properly this time.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.880
As for living expenses, let the
damn dogs worry about that.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.460
Really?

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.290
I can really try?

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:30.340
Even if I might not make it?

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.430
Why start by thinking you won't?

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.670
If you're going for it,
believe you'll win the damn thing.

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:41.340
Then, I'm really going for it, Mom.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.640
I'll do my best.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.360
I'll give it everything I've got.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.450
Thank you, Mom.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.340
Yeah, you'd better thank me.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.790
You got that offer because you resemble me.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.360
Your figure, your face. You've got it all.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.930
And back in my day, my height was
considered tall. You know?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.330
Gosh, my daughter is competing for Miss Korea.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.060
I'll give Miss Korea a shot.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.000

Oppa!

You must find this fun.

Showing up out of the blue.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.820
Yes, it's fun.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.740
Watching you tearing out in a rush.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.500
Doesn't your brain feel fried
after studying all day?

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.530
Do you want to unwind with me again?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.150
Keep your eye on the ball.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.830
It's all about timing.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.890
Focus. Timing!

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.300
Your batting average is way down today.

Tell me about it.

It's not going my way.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.790
Can you try it?

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.230
I've got no energy left.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.570
Wow! You're so good! So good!

Whoa!

This is good.

Are you sure?

Half of it is melted. I shouldn't
have bought you ice cream.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.160
Why? I'm trying my best here.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.110
Don't force it.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.310
You're having a hard time right now.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.880
Want to sit for a minute?

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.910
You really are a Seo Jong Hui specialist.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.390
To be honest,

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.730
I came today, so you'd notice
what a rough time I'm having.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.230
Why?

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.450
What's troubling you this time?

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.870
Too many things.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.950
Hope, disappointment, greed,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.060
jealousy, love.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.430
And that blurry feeling where you love
someone but also resent them.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.960
I think people struggle because
we're creatures of emotion.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.210
You can push through other hardships,
but when it comes to emotions...

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.880
They're hard to control.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.190
That's right.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.180
The heart is hard to control. Even if it's my own.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.890
Looking back,

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.550
I think timing is the most important.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.690
Even in baseball, you have to swing in time,

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.680
or your average tanks. Like today.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.260
But you had a great pinch-hitter
with perfect timing today.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.320
You're right. You were there for me.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.870
I've come to realize something in my life.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.900
Now is just as important as timing.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:08.600
What I'm doing now ultimately
creates my next chance.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.120
So, there's still a chance.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.240
You think so?

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.390
I'm glad I came to you.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:33.490
I think my heart feels so much relief
after talking to you.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.210
You need to get back, right?

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.600
No, I'm going straight home today.

Not today.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.070
All right.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.010

Yeong Rye is entering Miss Korea.

Miss Korea?

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.960
Yeah. Her salon director suggested it.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.820

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:38.150
We have this one, too.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.960
Should I take her to a department store?

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.060
I want to dress her up and
get her something tasty.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.210
Oh, this one is pretty!

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.710
This is pretty.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.620
Do you have this dress one size bigger?

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.690
- I do.
- This is perfect.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.070
Right, Su Jin? This is pretty-

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.250
Su Jin?

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.450
Su Jin.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.930
Where did she go? Where's Su Jin... Su Jin.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.960
Su Jin!

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.120
Su Jin!

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.500
- Su Jin!
- Su Jin!

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.660
- Su Jin!
- Did you find her?

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.230
No. Where does she usually-

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.420
She's not on this side!

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.320
We checked everywhere she might go.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.410
None of the market folks has seen her.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:26.210
Where could that little thing have gone?

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.960
Gosh, my heart is trembling.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.820
What should we do?

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.370
Ho Suk!

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.930
Jeong Bun, I think we should
report this to the police.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.490
Aigoo...

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.880
What happened, huh?

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.470
If you're watching a child, you watch her well!

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:54.500
What distracted you that you lost her?

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.930
I wasn't messing around.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.780
I just wanted to buy her a dress.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.800
I told you we don't need anything!

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.840
We don't, so stop showing up!

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.470
Why make a fuss after all this time,

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.790
trying to play dad all of a sudden?

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.140
Where's my Su Jin?

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.670
Su Jin! Su Jin.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.760
My baby. My baby...

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.850
K-Kite.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:26.730
Kite!

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.550
Kite! Su Jin. Kites! Kite, kite!

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:32.050
Where?

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.910
Su Jin!

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.430
Uncle.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.200
You-

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.920
It's okay.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.700
Uncle is here. It's okay.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.500
It's okay. It's okay.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.810
It's okay...

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.630
Uncle is here, so it's okay.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.330
Uncle is here, so it's okay.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:12.850
Su Jin!

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.630
Mommy!

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.490
She's okay.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:23.480
We found her. It's okay.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:30.550
Stop crying, you two. It's okay.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.510
Uncle is here...

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.590
Hey, mister.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.360
Let me borrow your lighter.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.660
How's it going?

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.690
Got any work these days?

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:26.100
The skilled ones get hired quickly.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.260
For the rest, it's all luck.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.530
Today is a bust, too.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:35.810
Shit. It's always down to skills.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:42.000
If I find a job, I'll treat you really nicely.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.900
For lending me this lighter. Okay?

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.540
Which brings me to ask.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.650
Do you have enough to buy soju, mister?

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.870
One, two, three, four.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.420
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.750
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.870
One, two.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.680
Stop. Stop.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:15.890
No. 11.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.490
Yes.

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.400
You're off-beat.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.530
Why do you keep missing the count?

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.970
In a group number,

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:26.220
the whole thing flops
if even one person breaks form.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.310
From the front, it really sticks out.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:29.580
I'm sorry.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.590
Ma'am.

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:36.110
Moving side-to-side feels a little too simple.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.830
After the side steps,

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.430
how about we add a spin at the end like this?

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:48.430
All right. Like this? One, two, three.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:49.900
What do you think?

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.970
All right. Ready? Start!

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:54.860
One, two, three, four.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.570
One, two.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.870
One, two, three, four. One!

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.070
Oh, you're very good.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.610
Good.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.550
Let's take it from the top.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.060
Ready, start!

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:12.150
One, two, three, four. One...

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.110
Left, right. Left, right.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:20.700
Again.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.010
One, two, three.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:27.420
Left, right.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.640
Again.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.610
What's wrong with me?

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:41.790
You've got two left feet, Ko Yeong Rye.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.720
Jong Hui...

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.220
You can do this, Ko Yeong Rye.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.600
One, two, three, four.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.260
Left, right.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.090
One, two, three, four.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:29.810
Left, right. Oh, I'm doing it.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.400
One, two, three, four.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.180
Left, two.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.600
I'm doing it!

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.580
I did it! I did it!

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.430
Again, again.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:57.380
Ho Suk.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.790
Hey, Ho Suk.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.720
If you clam up like that,

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.320
you're scaring me.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.540
I'm sorry.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:23.720
I was going to tell you way sooner.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.680
I just couldn't get the words out.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.020
He was someone you knew

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.600
and I couldn't go around and say crazy stuff like,

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.350
"Her father is Mr. Kim," right?

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:43.600
Even so! You should've told me.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.010
After all the years we've spent together.

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:49.460
How could you keep something that big from me?

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.090
Your insides must have been torn up.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.810
Your poor heart must be
black-and-blue with bruises.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.650
How much...

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.380
How much!

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.500
Aigoo...

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.860
Ho Suk.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.630
No, no. It's on me.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:29.890
I should've caught on sooner.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:37.120
I should've shared your emotional load.

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:43.030
I'm thick as a brick. I'm sorry, Unni.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.170
No, don't be sorry.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.010
I'm the one who's sorry.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.100
I'm the bad one here.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.130
No. No.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:55.680
I'm the fool. I'm sorry.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.520
Hey, don't say that. I'm really sorry.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.330
How can you say that?

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.060
I'll be back.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.030
Man, that's killer.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.370
That was funny.

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:11.960
You said you'd crash here for a few days.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:15.230
Why aren't you leaving?

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.500
How many days has it been now?

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.200
I'm going.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.200
I will, but I need work
to earn cash for a flophouse.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.250
But there are no jobs. I keep striking out.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.090
The show is over.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:31.950
Is there anything good on?

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:39.600
The 40 finalists of the 1989,
33rd Miss Korea Pageant

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.170
have begun their training camp.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:46.870
Selected through fierce regional
prelims, the contestants

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.560
will undergo programs and
community service to cultivate

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:54.380
- My sister. T-That's my sister.
- the qualities expected of Miss Korea.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:57.400
Starting with the welcome ceremony last week,

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.030
they've visited an orphanage in Hanbong-dong...

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.380
She's your sister?

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.760
Yes! That's my little sister.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.490
Wow, that bitch. Talk about talent.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:10.080
I went to her work right
after I got out of prison,

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.790
but she wasn't there.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:13.340
And how did she?

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.960
Wow, shocking, man!

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.550
Where she worked?

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.050
Cheongah Transportation?

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.800
Wait, how do you know that?

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.450
Did you work there?

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.410
This is a meaningful encounter
for these 40 beauties...

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:32.740
So, Seo Jong Hui, the bus attendant
from Cheongah Transportation

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.700
is your sister?

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.820
That's what I'm telling you.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.760
There's something there.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.180
She's got backing, for sure.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.550
If I play this right, I might snag
something out of it.

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:49.460
Don't you think so, Hyungnim?

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.130
Everyone, can you hear me?

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:58.120
Yes!

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:02.950
Normally, outings aren't allowed
during training camp.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:07.580
But thanks to how well this cohort has kept up

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.850
with the heavy schedule and rehearsals,

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.660
we wrapped up early.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:16.650
With special permission
from the Association President,

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:21.540
you're getting a half-day reward outing.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:26.630
Curfew is 9 p.m.

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.000
Anyone back after nine gets demerits,

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.810
so be on time. No exceptions.

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:33.930
Yes, sir!

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.530
Is Auntie Yeong Rye coming? Do you see her?

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:38.630
No.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:40.230
I don't see her yet.

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.300
Is she here yet? Do you see her?

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.180
No. I don't see a hair on her head.

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:48.820
It's only been two weeks, but I miss her to death.

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.890
She'll come eventually.

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.120
Stop making a fuss and just wait.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:57.550
Hello.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:59.190
Oh, she's here!

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:00.320
Yeong Rye!

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.320
Unni!

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.910
What took you so long?

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.240
Have you been well?

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.420
Is the food to your liking?

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.300
Do they skimp on the food?

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.300
You look so thin.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.870
Miss Korea is good and all,
but you need to eat well.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:18.470
I'm fine, Mom. I've been eating and living well.

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:21.240
Su Jin! How have you been?

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.890
- She's been good.
- You've been well?

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.930
Why did you prepare so much, Mom?

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:33.670
I shouldn't gain weight.

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:35.470
It's nothing much.

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:38.300
I just made some braised galbi,
stir-fried bulgogi,

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.630
cooked your favorite soybean paste stew,
mixed some japchae,

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:43.560
tossed a few greens, and fried a few pancakes.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.320
What did I do? There's nothing much.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.770
Unbelievable.

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:50.720
I give you credit for having a generous hand.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.240
- Let's eat.
- Yeah, let's.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.970
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food.

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.770
Yeong Rye, try the japchae.

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:00.600
It's insanely good.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.840
Have some braised galbi, too.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:09.100
The seasoning is nice and savory.
It's dancing in my mouth.

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:12.000
And your favorite bean sprouts.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.970
Pumpkin pancake, too.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.500
Thanks.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.460
Me, too. I want to give you, too.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.810
What will you give me?

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:20.840
I'll give you anchovies.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.720
Aigoo, aigoo! I should try
Su Jin's anchovies first.

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:29.220
It's so good! Yummy!

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.880
Try this, too.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.280
Wait, when is Jae Pil coming?

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.620
That's right.

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.230
Mr. Ma said he'll come over
after his seminar or whatever ends.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.080
He'll get here when he gets here.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.890
Let's eat first.

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.570
It's good.

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:50.290
Gosh, look at our Miss Korea.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:52.280
You're so pretty!

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.640
Have you been well?

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.070
You're the same, Mr. Ma.

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:56.370
Uncle!

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.250
Aigoo, our Su Jin.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:00.910
Are you enjoying your meal?

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:02.300
Have a seat there.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.950
- Sure, Mother.
- Do you have a spoon?

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:04.980
I don't.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.520
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be divided into

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.970
basic life support and advanced life support.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:12.560
Into two levels.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.240
What's the difference?

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.530
It's the quality of resuscitation.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:21.200
Advanced life support is performed professionally

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:26.000
by medical personnel such
as 119 paramedics and doctors.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.400
So, what can be included in advanced life support?

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.800
You, the fidgeting intern.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.300
Yes, you. Answer the question.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.820
In addition to chest compressions,

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.660
they can perform intubation or
use drugs like epinephrine

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.840
and treat by observing the patient's condition.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.900
I guess you were concentrating.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.180
With the increase in emergency patients
from traffic accidents and so on,

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.520
emergency treatments like CPR
have become very important.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:06.200
Although we're running out of time,

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:09.500
you must get some practice,
so please come forward.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:13.400
We don't have many mannequins,
so come starting from the front.

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:17.160
Welcome.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.310
Have you been well?

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:19.910
- Yes.
- Where's Mom?

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:21.490
She just called.

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:24.230
She was out of town and only just
got back to the office.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.210
She'll be home after giving some urgent approvals

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:28.230
and asked me to have dinner ready.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:29.290
Are you hungry?

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:31.440
No, I'm okay. You can start preparing.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.210
Should I take the flowers?

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.440
I'll give it to her personally.

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.750
Let's reschedule the board item.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:51.120
I need more time to review.

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.310
Yes, ma'am.

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:53.880
I have to go. My daughter is waiting.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.840
Yes, of course.

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.930
Chairwoman, a man in the lobby says
he's Seo Jong Hui's brother.

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.840
He's asking to see you.

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:11.740
All right. Send him up.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.070
See?

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:24.890
I told you dropping "Seo Jong Hui's brother"
would get us in.

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:27.150
I cleared the path like we agreed,

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:29.690
so you handle the rest.

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:34.680
I spook easily around big shots like
chairmen and directors.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:38.960
And remember, we split it 50-50.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.370
Don't worry about me.

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:44.100
Just keep your end of the bargain.

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:48.440
All right.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:53.850
This is proof that I'm Seo Jong Hui's
biological brother.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:55.540
[Household Registration Certificate]

00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:00.220
And this is the insurance policy
our parents took out.

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.330
[Insurance Certificate]

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:05.310
After our parents passed away,

00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:10.430
that bitch collected the entire payout.

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:13.020
That's the type of bitch she is.

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.480
Did you know that before you adopted her?

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:24.250
You think I'd adopt her
without checking that much?

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:25.500
What?

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:30.870
I heard there was a brother who seized
the payout and gambled it away.

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:33.310
You're lower-class than I expected.

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:38.750
You really think her background
is leverage over me?

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:41.710
Then,

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:47.640
if Seo Jong Hui were a criminal
who committed attempted murder...

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:54.920
would that be a threat?

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:01.510
That bitch stabbed me with a fountain pen.

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:04.750
Seven years ago at the Cheongah
Transportation office.

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:09.470
Because of that incident, I became
disabled and can't use my shoulder.

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:16.130
If I leak this to the press...

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:21.710
it'll get in the way of her becoming Miss Korea.

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:53.210
Even if that's true, I won't negotiate.

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:55.990
I know how people like you work.

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:59.280
Once becomes twice, and the demands are endless.

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.720
If you want to expose it, then go ahead.

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.040
I'll deal with it my way.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.830
So, are we done here?

00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:08.800
Take care on your way back.

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:38.740
They said she left the office. That's strange.

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.500
You should go ahead and eat.
You must be hungry.

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.060
I'll reheat the steak again.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.430
No, it's fine.

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:48.000
I don't think there's enough time to eat.

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.940
Hyungnim. Hold on.

00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.820
Hold on, Hyungnim.

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.560
Hyungnim!

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:04.750
Is it true?

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:08.790
That Jong Yeon- No.
That Jong Hui stabbed you?

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:10.420
You never told me that.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:14.440
There's only one reason I played along with you.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.320
I thought it'd be convenient to get to her.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.000
But now that it's come to this,
let's go our separate ways.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.480
I'll never give up.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.880
Shit.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.280
What the hell did that bitch do?

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.260
This puts me in a difficult position.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.080
Shit.

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:16.290
This is Hyeonseong Daily, right?

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:25.570
I have a tip about this year's
Miss Korea candidate.

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.700
Yeong Rye!

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.620
Yeong Rye!

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:49.190
Ko Yeong Rye!

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.110
Han Jae Pil?

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:55.420
Umbrella. Get in here.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.160
Jae Pil.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.670
I'm sorry. The seminar ended too late.

01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:03.320
I called your house,

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.610
but they said you left already,
so I caught a taxi-

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:18.570
I missed you so much.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.120
I missed you so much, Ko Yeong Rye.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.250
Me, too.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:27.910
I missed you so much, too, Han Jae Pil.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.020
Why didn't you use the umbrella when it's raining?

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.400
I was in a hurry.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.010
You got even more handsome
while I hadn't seen you, Dr. Han Jae Pil.

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:51.430
Hardly. You kept me up at night
because I missed you.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.520
Here.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.420
What's this?

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.810
It's delicious.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.510
- It's good?
- Yeah.

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.230
I had two bowls of rice,

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:08.850
but I still have room for this.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:13.310
I'm going to return from this outing as a pig.

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:15.430
Pig is fine,

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:16.800
and hamster is fine.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.820
Miss Korea or not, it's okay.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.030
I'm fine as long as it's Ko Yeong Rye.

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:28.040
Han Jae Pil, you've gotten kind
of cheesy while I was gone.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.200
Are you taking classes at an
academy to learn these lines?

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.080
Hey, stop that.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.990
- Don't.
- Come on.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.270
Hey!

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:41.950
All right.

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:43.210
Want some, too?

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.610
Yeah, I do.

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:46.940
Watching you eat is making me hungry.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.720
Here. Say, ah.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.600
Mom!

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.100
You came straight here?

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:14.050
I was actually waiting for you at home-

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:21.570
Your brother and that bus company
manager came to see me.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:23.900
He said you nearly killed him.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.660
They're threatening to tip off the press
for attempted murder.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.800
Why should I be subjected to threats
from bottom-feeders like that?

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.270
Just how far down did you sink?

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:49.090
I'll handle this quietly on my end.

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:54.010
In return, you do whatever it takes to win Jin.

01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:57.380
Otherwise, the humiliation I just
swallowed won't be worth it.

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:47.270
- Jong Hui.
- Don't.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.660
- Jong Hui.
- Let go!

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:07.520
What's wrong?

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.700
What on earth happened?

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:18.100
What happened that your mom came
all the way here and laid a hand on you?

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.410
This isn't...

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.410
the first time, is it?

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.040
Huh?

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:35.710
She loves you when it suits her,

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:38.920
but she yells and hits when it doesn't.

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.990
Is that what it's like being her daughter?

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:43.530
Is it?

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:51.590
Why live like that?

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:54.720
Why?

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.900
Even if you're a rich family's daughter,

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.880
this isn't happiness. Right?

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.030
Why force yourself to live there like that?

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:09.390
That's not like Seo Jong Hui.

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:13.740
Why do I live like this?

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:19.050
You really don't know?

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.320
It's because of you.

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:34.020
At Cheongah Transportation, I was so happy.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.550
On off-days, I went to your place,

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:42.680
snuck ramen with Jeong Bun and Ho Suk.

01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:46.360
For the first time in my life, I felt happy there.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.660
Why do you think I left there?

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:51.530
Why do you think...

01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:56.810
I told Jae Pil we should break up

01:07:56.810 --> 01:08:00.850
saying things I didn't even mean? Why?

01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:09.770
What are you saying?

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:17.900
You broke up with Jae Pil because of me?

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:23.370
I knew.

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:28.150
I knew you liked him.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.920
I knew everything back then.

Jong Hui.

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:44.200
But I shouldn't have.

01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:49.190
I should've turned a blind eye
and stayed with him.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.530
You...

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.230
You have a family who really loves you,

01:08:57.230 --> 01:09:01.270
Jeong Bun, and Ho Suk. But I...

What...

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:08.600
What did I have to be so proud of?

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.030
I didn't have anything to show for.

Feels like Yeong Rye entered
training just yesterday,

and the pageant is here already.

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:05.580
They said they're taping the preshow today.

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:08.230
What's so fast about it?

01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:11.950
For Jae Pil, the last three weeks
must've felt like three years.

01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:15.550
Totally. Oppa has been moping
around with that long face.

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:17.370
I guess it's Yeong Rye over me now.

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:20.810
Of course. You like Yeong Bae over me now, too.

Isn't this going to tangle
the family tree like crazy?

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.160
What if we end up double in-laws someday?

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.020
You're getting ahead of yourself again.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.760
They're middle schoolers,
and you're talking double in-laws.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.170
Hey, you never know with people. Right?

01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:40.620
I'm in favor. What's wrong with double in-laws?

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.830
Anyway, Yeong Rye must be so nervous right now.

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:49.790

You need to do this well.

- I'll fix it for you.
- No, it's good.

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:30.650
It looks unbalanced here.

Be sure to smile starting now.

Confidence comes from posture,

No, not much.

Hello.

I am Jeong Hyeon, CEO of Hwashin Apparel.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.400
Oh, wow!

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:45.610
How did this happen?

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:48.730
How are you a sponsor's representative?

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.800
It worked out that way. I didn't push for it.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.930
My father set it up, and it ended up
with me when I took over Apparel.

01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:00.820
I did decline being a judge, though.

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.930
I wasn't sure I could set aside personal feelings.

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.620
That's too bad.

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:09.240
If you were a judge, I'd have it in the bag.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.120
Really? Should I say yes now?

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.590
No, no.

I was nervous, but seeing you
makes me feel much better.

01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:23.520
I'm energized.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.070
Good.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.160
Do you know where Daddy-Long-Legs gets his name?

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.270
Not sure. I don't really remember.

01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:38.140
Because when he turns away,
only a long shadow remains.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.190
I'm not judging,

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:47.240
but remember that I will always be behind you
