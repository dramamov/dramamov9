00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.160
Where were you two all night?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.400
And what happened?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.400
Why do you look like this?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.840
Both of us got attacked.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.320
Attacked?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.160
Attacked by who?

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.096
Is there anyone else other than the four of us?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.520
Right.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560
If there was someone else out there

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.360
why would they attack their own people?

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.360
He’s a beast.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160
Hideous.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
Disgusting.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.120
Filthy.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.240
As low as Satan

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.520
locked away in hell

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.280
never to be reborn.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.240
He’s human just like us

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.680
with flesh and blood

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840
with a heart

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.360
a face and hair.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.280
Like they were created by some kind of torture.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.080
But when he bit me

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.480
I don’t think he actually meant to.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.840
Because if he really wanted to bite me

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.440
I wouldn’t be alive right now.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.280
His eyes looked

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080
full of sorrow

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360
full of fear

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.640
fear of something worse than death.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.240
He seemed like

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.400
like Taiyo said.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.240
But I felt something soft in him.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.880
Maybe he was trying to warn me

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240
trying to help

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.400
or trying to tell me something.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
Soft?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.360
Soft, my ass!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.800
Look at us.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.720
If I hadn’t saved you

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.000
you’d have been dead alongside him right now.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.480
You can’t judge things based on your emotions alone.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.920
Use your brain.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.720
I think you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.640
have lost it after getting bitten.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.160
And between your brain and your emotions

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280
what’s the difference?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.200
I’m sure I’m not imagining things.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.920
Then think about what’s actually possible.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.680
Don’t make random guesses by yourself

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.200
and say he’s good because of that

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280
good because of this.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.040
If he was actually good like you’ve said

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880
why did he attack us?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.320
Maybe he didn’t mean to attack us.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.840
He just didn’t know how to communicate

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.320
or how to handle things like we do.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840
Or

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.736
Maybe he was being controlled by something.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.880
Controlled?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600
Iron

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.480
be realistic here.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.160
Who would be controlling him?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.200
I only saw him

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.120
you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680
and me.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.240
Weird.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360
Really weird.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.040
The first time the four of us met

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.760
we almost killed each other.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120
Don’t you guys remember?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880
Yeah.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.520
And

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.200
what if there were another four before us?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.280
But maybe they killed each other

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.200
and only one survived.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.760
Or maybe there are others out there

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.800
that we haven’t met yet.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.080
Right now, anything’s possible.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360
Right.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.160
If that thing hadn’t saved us

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.160
the four of us would’ve killed each other by now.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.160
The devil in there

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040
saved us?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.760
Bite me.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.560
Swallow me.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.000
Only an idiot

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.120
would believe something like that.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.480
Can you just shut up for once?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.160
What did you just say?

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.280
Then who else would act weak like you?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.240
Not sure if you’re actually weak

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.400
or if you’re just pretending

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.840
to get someone’s attention.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.560
So you want me to fake, acting like a good person like you?

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280
Not happening.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.800
I never said I was a good person.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.600
I’m just trying to stay alive.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.440
If you wanna die, be my guest.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.000
Just go ahead and die

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.680
since you’re acting like a coward anyway.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.840
Haven’t you heard?

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.560
The weak

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960
tend to die first.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.320
Why waste your time?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.120
You have no right

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.120
to tell someone to die

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400
or live.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.680
You’re not God.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.120
So, you still believe

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.240
God fucking exists?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.400
He never existed.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.200
Dumbass!

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.960
He’s just something made up

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.320
to fool idiots like you.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.040
Didn’t you say it yourself?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.120
Why isn’t it possible?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.120
Is what you believe

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.880
the only possibility?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Enough already!

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.560
Why are we fighting each other?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.120
Shouldn’t we be thinking about

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440
what to do next?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.120
That ferocious beast

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.760
might lead us to the truth.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.000
Then we’ll finally know

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960
who we are

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520
where we came from

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.080
and what happened to this world.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.200
A world that once had everything.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.640
Ferocious

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.320
but maybe better than us humans.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.360
We’re no difference from Kannis.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480
So what are you saying?

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.520
Are we different from Kannis or not?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.680
Different or not

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.200
we need to find answers

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
what happened

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.560
and what he wanted from us.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.480
But from what I saw and felt

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.600
there was something intelligent

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.679
that fails for the smallest things

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.680
that are invisible.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.840
It’s like a natural trap we were born with.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.560
They’re flaws that we’re kind of aware of

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.160
but we overlook them.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.560
Those flaws

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.280
will then come back to bite us

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.920
and drag us into catastrophe.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.720
Ananke.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360
Ananke?

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.760
That’s right.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560
Ananke.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.400
Who is Ananke?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.360
I

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.880
Am fate.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560
The power of faith.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240
I

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.000
Am the most powerful dictator in every situation.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.280
Some of my beliefs

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.000
make me reflect on

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.480
who I am

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.880
where I came from

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440
why I was born

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.400
and how I was born.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.600
Was I meant to exist with others

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.720
or to be alone?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.880
And where did everyone else go?

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.280
Why are only the four of us left

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.320
with no memories at all?

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440
In the end

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960
no one

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440
or nothing is perfect.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.440
We were all created flawed

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.080
distorted

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.960
broken and shattered.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.600
Then we piece ourselves back together

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.239
to become more perfect.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.840
While we’re still breathing

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.680
we’re all afraid

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.440
and filled with pity.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.480
The only way to overcome it

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.560
is to face it.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.560
Seek out the flaws

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.960
and fix them.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.080
Conquer fear at every moment.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.080
Turn it into awareness

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.000
and truly understand ourselves

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.200
and purify our souls.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.720
Everything in this world

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.320
has an origin.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.240
There used to be something called religion.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.040
Religion?

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040
What’s religion?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.560
Belief

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.800
or something

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.000
that teaches people to be good.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.280
And what makes someone a good person?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.880
I’m not sure.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.400
But I think there must be some kind of principles

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.520
something measurable.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.120
And who came up with those principles?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
That person

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.040
must have been a good person

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.960
accepted by many people

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.880
to be able to create them.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.800
It’s uncertain.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.520
Nothing is absolute.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.320
What we feel today

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640
tomorrow

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.280
yesterday

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.720
is never the same.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.320
Tomorrow, we might not even have air to breathe.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.600
I don’t believe there’s such a thing as the best person.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.160
There’s no way for us to know

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.680
if he were in a situation like this

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.840
would he really still be a good person?

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.320
You sound so pessimistic.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.240
Well, it’s kind of hard to be optimistic right now.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.840
Things could get even worse.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.120
Then why not try to find something good in it

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.480
so you can have hope?

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440
I’m not hopeless.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.880
I’m just looking at reality.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.240
Good people

00:10:46.241 --> 00:10:48.281
maybe they’re not as pure-minded as you guys think.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.840
They do good

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.880
just to make people think they’re good.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.520
That’s all.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.480
And how do you know what they’re thinking?

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.760
Can you read minds?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.440
If you can,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.120
then

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.000
try reading my mind to see

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.120
what I’m thinking right now.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.760
I don’t know.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.880
I’m just trying to understand it in my own way.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.160
You don’t know

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.320
or are you just pretending not to?

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.120
The way you reacted at that moment

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.600
gave me a good feeling, but I can’t even explain why.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.560
But there was someone

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480
who could do it.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.840
He reached the peak of being a good person.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.320
He could let go of everything in life

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.680
and elevated himself

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.480
to the highest level of belief

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680
spirituality

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.680
peace.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440
But

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.240
that was a long, long time ago.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.160
I don’t remember

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.240
who he was

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360
what his name was.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.600
He was just a selfish person.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200
Could a person

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.680
really have no feelings at all?

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.120
Letting go of everything

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.040
how can a human be that cold?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200
No idea.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.520
No idea at all.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.800
It just popped into my head

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.200
for a second. That’s all.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.640
I know of someone.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.680
This man is pretty good.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.720
He loved everyone

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.880
sought to redeem sins

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.040
and sacrificed his own life

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.640
for the happiness of others.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520
He chose love

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.800
overlooked hate.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.320
I know of someone who sought peace

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.640
never bowed to anyone.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.360
He could have started a war at any time.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.720
And he was highly persuasive among his own people.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.320
Those who followed him were extremely devoted

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.200
and willing to sacrifice their lives.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.680
It’s like anyone who wants to be a good person

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.120
must also be willing to sacrifice their life.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.080
If I say

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.240
a good person is someone who follows religion principles

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.736
then maybe I need to rethink things.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.040
Because if it’s someone like you

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.000
no matter what religion you follow

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.600
you’d probably end up destroying it.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And you

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.760
you’d probably follow every teaching

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.360
without ever thinking to question it.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.320
And you

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.920
you’d probably twist the teachings

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.840
and start your own religion.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.280
But there’s someone above all of that.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.320
He’s invisible.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.920
He’s the one pulling all the strings.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.040
Those good people

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.280
are just his tools.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.560
He’s called…

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.240
Called what?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.640
I don’t remember.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.800
You probably mean God.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.776
Why do you keep talking about him?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.800
So annoying.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240
If he really exists

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.560
then call him out.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.320
Where is he?

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400
Up in the sky?

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.280
Open your fucking eyes.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.880
Do you see anything besides emptiness?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.880
I’m not saying I don’t believe.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.800
If he does exist

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.160
I want to meet him once.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.680
I want to see him while I’m still human.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.200
I want to believe in an answer

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.440
that I can see with my own eyes

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.360
not just in stories

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.000
passed down by others.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.640
Whether a story is good or bad

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.680
depends on who’s telling it.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120
What are you doing?

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.000
I told you we’re not eating that.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.440
Why do you keep forcing us to eat that devil fruit?

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.320
Are you scared

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040
of the devil?

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.120
Or are you afraid we’ll see the real you?

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.280
If you’re not going to eat it

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.720
then don’t.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.640
Just eat some.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.480
It’ll help you feel better.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.080
At least, it’s better than not eating anything.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.840
Right, Copper?

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400
Try.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440
Thanks.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.480
Have you noticed that those two have been acting strange?

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.680
Strange how?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.040
I don’t know.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.640
But from what I’ve seen, I feel like

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.400
those two have feelings for each other

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.200
when they’re close.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400
Haven’t you noticed?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.640
How do you know

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.760
if those two have feelings for each other?

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.520
When you say feelings

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.480
what do you mean?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.920
Feelings are feelings.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.680
It’s not just the way people normally look at each other

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.760
It’s a deeper gaze

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.880
like they don’t want either of them to vanish from their lives.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.800
I’m not sure either.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.080
Maybe it’s something else.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.680
I guess I’m just imagining things.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440
Don’t mind me.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.120
Sometimes I just talk nonsense.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.720
Hey!

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.920
Don’t overthink it.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.520
It’s nothing.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.840
Overthink?

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.000
Why would I have to overthink it?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.960
They just looked at each other.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.440
See?

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.840
Even I can look at you.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.360
I’m just worried about you.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.680
I know you’re a good person.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.360
You like to help others.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.560
I just don’t want to see you sad.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.280
That’s all.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600
Sad?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.280
Why would I be sad?

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.480
Well, you were alone with him all night.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.400
And you fed him

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.320
this devil fruit.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.000
You think I don’t know

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.760
what happened between you and him?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.720
You felt something, didn’t you?

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.200
Last night

00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:05.480
when Iron got bitten by Kannis

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.800
he lost so much energy that he passed out.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.880
He could barely breathe.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.840
But he wouldn’t stop rambling.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.440
He just kept saying the name

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.360
Copper.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.840
“Copper.”

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.640
“Hold me.”

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.320
“I need warmth.”

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.960
“Kiss me.”

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.880
“I need air.”

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760
“That’s it.”

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.200
“Just like that.”

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.800
“I want you so bad.”

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.200
That voice kept repeating

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.600
all night long.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.160
Yeah?

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.360
It must’ve been the wound from Kannis’ bite.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.840
Don’t you think

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.640
while you and he were…

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.760
he might have felt that way about you

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.160
but he was actually just using you

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.480
as a substitute for Iron?

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.240
Who knows?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.120
He was with you

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.280
but he might’ve been thinking about someone else

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.160
because the body and the feelings

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.000
can be separated.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.240
Like the moon and the sun.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.840
They’ll never meet

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.280
but that doesn’t mean they can’t long for each other.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.440
Because if one of them disappeared

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.760
the world would lose its balance.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.120
Right?

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.960
I think Marduk is acting weird.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.520
Like something’s on his mind.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.640
I can’t quite put my finger on it.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.520
Iron, can you try talking to him?

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.240
And why do I have to go talk to him?

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.680
He seems fine to me.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.480
I tried talking to him

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.800
but it didn’t make things any better.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.600
I think

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.560
he probably wants to talk to someone he’s comfortable with.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.560
I think if you talk to him

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.560
you might be able to help.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.480
So, what’s up with you?

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120
I…

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.520
I just…

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.280
I know how you feel.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.560
Some feelings

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.960
can’t be put into words or explained.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.040
But if it ever gets too much

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.320
if you need to let it out

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.560
or if you want my help with anything

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.960
just let me know.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.120
Do you think there’s something weird between those two?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.240
I thought

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.920
he had feelings for you.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.240
But why

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.040
all he thinks about is Iron?

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840
But it’s probably normal.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.680
There are only a few of us here.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160
It’s nothing.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.960
Are you sure

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.520
that’s normal?

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.520
Let me think.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.640
Last night

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.800
after Iron got bitten by Kannis

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.440
he lost so much energy that he passed out.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.840
I was really weak, too.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400
At that moment

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.640
I really thought I was going to die.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.520
But all of a sudden

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.480
I felt this warmth I can’t even explain.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.360
Those arms

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.720
wrapped around me.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.999
That warm chest

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
brought me back to life.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320
At the same time

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.880
I could hear Iron’s faint voice

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.320
full of intense emotion.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160
That voice

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.440
I could hear it the whole time.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.720
It was like

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.920
there was only desire in this world.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.920
Look at the way those two look at each other.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.239
He seems concerned

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.400
extra caring.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.200
Not the way he was with you.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.280
He seems worried

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.040
about whether Iron is okay.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.360
Because if something really happened to Iron

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.800
he’d be devastated.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.720
But whatever.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040
It’s nothing.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.400
Nothing?

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.720
It might have just been

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.520
my imagination.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.640
What if it really happened?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.960
I don’t know.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.560
I can’t say for sure.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.480
Because if it’s not true

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.920
then I’ll just look like a jerk.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.880
But I think it’s true

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.720
because he and I

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.440
You and

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.960
who?

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.120
Me and Marduk.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560
What?

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.120
What happened between you and him?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.360
Me and Marduk

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.720
we kissed.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.880
I’m sorry.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.480
I

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.760
Shouldn’t have told you.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.400
Better than making me look like an idiot

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.600
keeping me in the dark.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.520
The issue isn’t whether you know or not

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.000
but it’s about

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.400
what you do, now that you know.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.560
If Marduk wasn’t in the picture

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.480
Iron might have feelings for you.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.360
You wouldn’t have to feel bad

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.239
like you’re being looked down on

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.760
like your heart is being played with.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.840
People

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.800
you can’t really tell by their face.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560
What do you mean?

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160
At least

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.560
you wouldn’t feel so alone.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.840
Thanks a lot, Iron.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640
Let’s go inside.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.040
The weaker ones have to die.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.720
By die, I mean

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.640
they just disappear from this world.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.440
And there are many ways to disappear from the world.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.640
That’s just how the world works.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.119
If there are people who are happy

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.400
there must be people who suffer.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.640
You just have to suck it up

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.200
get through this emotional moment.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.680
Honestly

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.360
those two look perfect together.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.360
What do you think?

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.000
Stop!

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:14.680
Let go of me!

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.120
Stop!

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.360
Let go of me, damn it!

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440
Stop!

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.520
Let go of me!

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.600
Come here.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.680
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.760
I’m sorry.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.600
What the hell are you guys doing?

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.760
Copper

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.320
what have you done?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.560
Why did you do it?

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.880
I don’t know.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.640
I couldn’t control it.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.280
I saved your life, Copper.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.760
Do you remember?

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.560
You almost died.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.200
And this is how you repay me?

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.040
You want Iron so bad

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.760
that you’re going to kill me?

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.680
What is he talking about?

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.360
Answer me!

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.480
The reason why these two are like this

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.480
is because of you

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.560
Iron.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.880
Because of me?

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.360
Because of me?

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.400
What did I do to piss you guys off?

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.720
Huh?

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.520
Answer me!

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.560
Answer me!

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.240
Answer!

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.440
Answer me!

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
I hate you.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.200
You really don’t know, Iron?

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.560
When you act all nice to everyone

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.280
deep down, how do you really feel?

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.160
Are you faking it?

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.160
Or do you just not feel a damn thing?

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.240
It was you, right?

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.920
Who made this whole thing up?

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.040
Why did you do it?

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080
What did I do?

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.440
Why not assume these two are lying?

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.840
You can’t even trust yourself.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400
You’re pathetic.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.920
I’m not lying.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.280
I’m not lying either.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.160
Tell us what really happened that night.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.400
Say something.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.960
Why are you not saying anything?

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.920
You can’t even remember yourself.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.840
Then how can you call me a liar?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.400
I don’t remember.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.400
But that doesn’t mean what you said is true.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.720
I should feel something

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.680
but I don’t feel anything.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.560
Especially with you

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.880
I don’t feel a thing.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.640
I’ve never even thought about killing anyone

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.400
even if you don’t feel a thing for me.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.960
But the ones who shared kisses

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.560
now want to take the other one’s life out of this broken world.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.280
There’re only a few of us left, so why would you do that?

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.520
I want to know, too.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.200
You two kissed.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.880
You want to kill him

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.280
because he doesn’t have feelings for you.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.480
You want everyone to desire you, Copper.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.440
You brought this on yourself.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.640
How is that my fault?

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.480
I was just minding my own business

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.680
but you guys

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.560
are putting all the blame on me.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.120
I didn’t think anything.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.320
It was just a kiss.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.320
I didn’t feel anything.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.320
Enough already!

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.160
What the hell are you doing?

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.440
If me being here

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.200
is just causing problems

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080
Hey!

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.320
I’ll just leave.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.160
Are you happy now?

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.360
You want us to hate each other.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800
You’re an asshole.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.360
Iron would think you’re a good person.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.720
A good person in the guise of a demon.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800
You’re not human.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.640
A good person in the guise of a demon

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.320
or a demon in the guise of a good person

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.399
there’s no difference.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.400
It’s different.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.960
At least

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.320
I’ve never thought about hurting anyone

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.200
with this kid of hatred.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.560
I wish you happiness.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280
Eat well.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.760
Sleep well.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.160
Live comfortably.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.840
You and I, let’s just die together right here.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.359
People like you shouldn’t be alive.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.360
Hey, stop!

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.040
Let go!

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.880
Let go of me!

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.256
Let go of me! I’ll gonna kill him.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.080
I said let go of me!

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.160
I said let go of me!

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.920
You only care about yourself.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440
You and he

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.440
are the same, no conscience at all.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.040
He’s the problem.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.120
Don’t you realize that?

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.200
You might be right

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.080
but I don’t want you to regret it later.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.640
If he dies today

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.320
he’ll never know how coward

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.840
evil

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.520
and selfish he is.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.800
You gotta let him live.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.920
Let him live with sorrow

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.760
pain

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.840
and guilt for the rest of his life.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.880
Why are you guys talking nonsense?

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.880
Pain

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.560
sorrow

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.400
guilt

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.840
they can’t get to me.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.680
Dumbasses!

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.960
You guys take each other’s side, thinking you’re right.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.760
Taiyo, you damn beast!

00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:37.800
I’m Taiyo

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.080
who is above everything in this world.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.640
Death or whatnot can’t do anything to me.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.800
I’ll make sure you know and see that

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.880
I’m capable of way more than you think.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.680
You admit it now, right?

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.880
This whole thing

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.920
you did it, right?

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.760
I never admit anything.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.600
How you think is your business.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.240
It’s none of my business.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.240
In case, that’ll make you

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.880
feel better and

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.000
feel less guilty.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.360
You and I, let’s part ways right here.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.960
Just go wherever you want.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.280
Don’t bother me.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.080
Aren’t you glad

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.800
to see me here?

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.760
Here

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.480
I’m giving the devil fruit

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.240
back to you.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.880
Whatever happened in the past

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.120
let it stay there.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.040
Now

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.600
it’s just the two of us.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.280
What are you doing?

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.400
I’ll do just what the devil fruit is trying to tell you.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640
What does it say?

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.760
Don’t be so naive.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.040
Didn’t we both see the same image?

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.320
The image of us being happy

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.520
somewhere

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.880
just the two of us.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.720
No!

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.160
No!

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.040
It wasn’t you and me in that image.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.080
You want this devil fruit, right?

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:44.840
Take it.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.960
I don’t want it anymore.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160
No.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.040
Then what do you want?

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.880
I want you.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.080
Copper!

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.280
I’m lonely?

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.560
What’s lonely?

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.640
No.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.160
Not lonely.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.840
We have so many of us here.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Right?

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:46.880
Run.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.280
We have to run away.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.280
If we don’t run away, we’ll die for sure.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.360
How are we gonna escape?

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.800
There’re guards everywhere.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.840
And just the two of us will escape?

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.520
What about the rest of us?

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.000
We’ll all run away together.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.960
If we don’t run away

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.680
we’re no different from that horror.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.720
I heard a voice.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.040
Sweetheart.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.120
The voice sounded

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.360
like trying to help.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.000
This way.

00:42:42.001 --> 00:42:43.199
Don’t tell me

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:43.760
Ananke came back.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.760
This way.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.840
Quick, run!

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.600
It’s like someone knew we’d be here

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.440
right now.
