00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.975
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.450
{\an8}Your Majesty.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:19.204
{\an8}We have brought Yeon Ji-young
of the royal kitchen.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:47.982
The man I'm about to face

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.485
is Joseon's greatest gourmet

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.987
and also the worst tyrant,

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.489
{\an8}Yeonhuigun.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:55.949
{\an8}YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:03.456
{\an8}Your Majesty, you must sentence
the gwinyeo to capital punishment

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.042
{\an8}and restore order to the throne.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.504
- Please restore order to the throne.
- Please restore order to the throne.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.236
Last night,

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:38.324
this woman served me a strange dish
and confused my senses.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.751
Therefore,
I command that she be immediately…

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.977
{\an8}appointed as the chief royal cook!

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.353
{\an8}CHIEF ROYAL COOK:
THE HEAD COOK OF THE ROYAL KITCHEN

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:08.730
{\an8}What?

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.941
- What? The chief royal cook?
- The chief royal cook?

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.401
A woman?

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:15.194
Starting today,

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.573
you are to cook for me
every day without fail.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:19.490
However,

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.451
if you ever serve the same dish
more than once,

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.161
or if it is not to my liking,

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.040
you will be sentenced to death.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.042
You've got to be kidding me.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:32.295
All I ever dreamed of was becoming
a three-star Michelin chef.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:35.548
Instead, today,
I became the chef of a tyrant.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.509
Do you have anything to say?

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.719
Or…

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.972
do you wish to die now?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.077
He's going to kill me eventually,
isn't he?

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:07.455
I'll survive and go back,

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.540
no matter what.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.380
Your Majesty.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:18.633
I am guilty of confusing you with my food.

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:22.220
Although our contract
is not entirely fair…

00:04:24.722 --> 00:04:25.848
I will serve you

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.810
as best as I can until the end.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.412
My name is Yeon Ji-young.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.289
You'll never believe it,

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.499
but I'm from the year 2025.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.876
How did I end up here?

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.296
Well…

00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:03.094
COURSE Nº 1 GOCHUJANG BUTTER BIBIMBAP

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.852
{\an8}LA POÊLE D'OR
COOKING COMPETITION

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.437
{\an8}Ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.857
{\an8}La Poêle d'Or,
the number one French cooking competition

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.609
{\an8}to find an innovative new chef.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.487
The final mission
is to create a spread for a king,

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.907
and I'm seeing
some fantastic dishes take shape.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.159
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:27.785
The month-long competition

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.954
is now down to the last five minutes!

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.756
Excuse me! Sir!

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.093
Yes? What's the matter?

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.636
My stove isn't working.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.679
Pardon?

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:56.064
We have four minutes left.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:06:00.401
Please keep in mind you're disqualified
if you don't finish your dish in time.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.071
The winner will receive 100,000 euros…

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:16.167
as well as the head chef position
at Paul Bonnard's "Happy Cure,"

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.669
a Michelin three-star restaurant.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.645
What are you doing, ma'am? Are you insane?

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:36.979
A little.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.941
You can't make a fire
with unauthorized materials.

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:44.779
"There's nothing worse
than an incomplete dish."

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.197
A French saying, right?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.698
I completely agree.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.160
I'd rather go a little crazy.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.496
Wait, no…

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.301
{\an8}Now, it's time for searing,
or flame-grilling.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.554
{\an8}Although the steak is cooked
through and through,

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.931
this step is essential

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.226
because it browns the surface

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.645
and creates a unique flavor and aroma.

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.313
{\an8}This is known as the Maillard reaction.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.777
You have two minutes left.
Please complete your dishes.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:57.185
One minute to go. Please do not touch
anything when the time is up.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.469
Time's up!

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:34.430
It's now time for the judges to decide
who will be crowned the winner.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.265
Stay tuned!

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.060
{\an8}LA POÊLE D'OR
COOKING COMPETITION

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.729
Please introduce your dish.

00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:45.024
This is called "hünkâr beğendi,"

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:47.610
- which is Turkish for "Sultan's delight."
- It's a creative combination, but…

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.196
I don't think the sultan
would be very impressed.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:52.281
Back in the Age of Discovery,

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:56.619
spices like cloves
were more valuable than gold,

00:08:56.702 --> 00:09:00.706
and royals had dishes made
with these spices to flaunt their power.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.833
To be honest,
this combination doesn't work.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.336
Hello, sirs. This is turkey roulade,

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:09.632
which was favored by Marie Antoinette,
the bride of Louis XVI. Please enjoy.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:15.805
I taste something new each time I chew.

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.056
However,

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:19.183
do you think the beef brisket
in the center

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.227
pairs well with the other ingredients?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.312
Oh, it's you.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.399
The problematic participant
who broke the rules.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:28.401
I prepared a venison chateaubriand.

00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:31.237
The tenderloin is reverse-seared
and smoked on rice straw.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.906
The sauce is made with red ginseng
and Korean blackberry,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.741
giving the dish a sweet and bitter touch.

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:37.535
This right here is a soybean purée

00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:41.372
and a tuile made with misutgaru,
a Korean grain powder.

00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:44.792
I also added hardy orange caviar
on the side.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.003
I can smell the strong smoky aroma.

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.130
The color of the steak
is better than I expected.

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:50.464
This steak is a royal dish

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.342
made using a centuries-old
straw-fire grilling technique

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.178
that originated in the Joseon Dynasty.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.180
The Joseon Dynasty?

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.098
That's right.

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.310
Long ago, when Korea was Joseon,
there was a Yeonhuigun.

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:05.688
He was a tyrant who was also a gourmet,

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:08.357
and this venison steak was his favorite.

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:22.830
The sweet but bitter sauce
really enhances the dish.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.335
Grilling with rice straw
is a very complex technique,

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:30.212
but the heat was transmitted
through the meat perfectly.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.757
And I can't smell the odor of the venison.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.259
Thank you very much.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.306
The greatest cooking competition
to find an innovative new chef,

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:41.682
La Poêle d'Or Season 5.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.018
The month-long competition
has come to an end.

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:48.064
At last, it's time to decide the winner,

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:50.483
the one who will win 100,000 euros

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:54.153
as well as the opportunity to work
at a Michelin three-star restaurant.

00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:57.573
The fifth person
to win the competition is…

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.909
This is very nerve-racking.

00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:06.832
What a surprise!

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.627
Madam Yeon Ji-young from Korea!

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.297
Congratulations! Please step forward!

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:17.635
Congratulations, Madam Yeon.

00:11:17.718 --> 00:11:22.014
Your chateaubriand
was an excellent reinterpretation

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.641
of the Joseon royal cuisine.

00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:26.644
You are more than qualified to become
the head chef of Happy Cure!

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.563
Well done.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.941
{\an8}Thank you! Thank you so much!

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.275
{\an8}2025 FRANCE LA POÊLE D'OR
100,000 EUROS

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:42.618
2025 FRANCE LA POÊLE D'OR

00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:58.342
What a beautiful night.

00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:02.054
Good night, Paris.

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:08.436
Did you see the news?

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.353
MY DEAR DAD

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:13.691
I'll be the head chef
of a Michelin three-star restaurant!

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:17.611
I even got 100,000 euros in prize money.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.947
Well done. I'm so proud of you.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.699
Are you flying back today?

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:23.868
Yeah. I'm packing
and will go straight to the airport.

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.580
My heart is still racing.

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:31.417
You must be tired.
You should stay back and rest for a while.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.960
{\an8}Apparently, there will be
a total solar eclipse later today.

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:34.170
{\an8}A total solar eclipse?

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.130
Hey, that's even better.

00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:37.923
I'll get to see that on the plane.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:38.966
Oh, right.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:41.844
I need you to bring a book back with you.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.304
What book?

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:45.055
It's a historical record from Joseon.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:47.516
I asked Professor Pierre
at Sorbonne University to get it for me.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.686
He said he'd send it to you,
so be sure to bring it.

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.146
Okay.

00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:54.064
I'll call you when I land.

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:57.276

I'll eat the bread later.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.774
I'm glad I kept this.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.152
Koreans can't live

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.987
without gochujang.

00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:46.408
It looks great.

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.934
Oh, that's hot!

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:13.644
Gosh, that's hot.

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:26.490
Oh no.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:27.575
Oh my gosh.

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:38.836
Oh no. This is bad.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:48.762
What do I do? This is an antique book.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:52.266
Let's dab off the smudges

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:54.643
with some water.

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.567

They're recipes.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.170
Is it a cookbook?

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.760
Why is this page torn?

00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:31.013
HWANSEBAN

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.976
{\an8}Something-se-ban?

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:38.562
I have no idea.

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:40.981
Are the front pages okay?

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:48.906
They're all wet. Gosh, what do I do?

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.999
"My dearly beloved,

00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:03.420
if you were to read this someday,

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:08.258
may you come back to my side"?

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.054
What?

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.349
It's a Joseon dynasty romance novel.

00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:17.142
MANGUNROK

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:26.527
What's going on? What's happening?

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.370
Hello?

00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:39.164
I'm in here!

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.709
Save me!

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:46.255
Why won't it open?

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:49.341
Hello? Will you unlock the door?

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:00.430
Let go of me!

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:02.266
How can you do this to me?

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:03.809
Drag the queen out!

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:05.894
Mother.

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.523
Your Majesty!

00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.817
Your Majesty, how could you--

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.944
Enough! Drag her away!

00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:15.863
Let go of me!

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:17.364
Mother--

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.076
- Your Majesty!
- You must not.

00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:24.288
You must hold back, Your Royal Highness.

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:27.708
You must hold back.

00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:43.891
Bull's eye!

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:06.246
- Chief Eunuch!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.710
Have the military officers

00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:14.463
{\an8}take the deer to Saongwon,
Office of Royal Meals.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.173
{\an8}Yes, Your Majesty.

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:18.383
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:21.929
It has gotten quite dark.

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.557
How about returning to the palace?

00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:29.478
The band of rebels
that appeared during your last hunt

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.688
could attack you again,

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:33.273
and I am greatly concerned.

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.984
How dare you speak of such things?

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.489
You worry too much.

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:42.449
My apologies, Your Majesty.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.160
This is too special a day

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.705
to cut short a hunting trip.

00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:56.171
It is time!

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:05.180
10TH YEAR OF YEONHUIGUN'S REIGN
YEAR OF THE BLUE MONKEY

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.974
Rise!

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:08.976
Bow!

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:10.769
Rise!

00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:13.981
His Majesty went out to hunt?

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:15.899
{\an8}What nonsense is that?

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:17.609
{\an8}The gusikrye, salvation ritual,
should have begun.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.111
GRAND ROYAL QUEEN DOWAGER INJU
YI HEON'S GRANDMOTHER

00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:20.696
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:23.365
I failed to fulfill my duty.

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:25.367
It is known that a solar eclipse

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.495
{\an8}is the heavens' way
of rebuking the king's wrongdoings.

00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:32.833
{\an8}His Majesty must not see
how serious the matter is.

00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:35.585
He should be practicing restraint
and refraining from killing, but instead--

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.462
Enough! That is enough!

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.882
Do you still not know His Majesty?

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:43.593
It is because of
the fourth junior consort.

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:44.845
The Confucian scholars

00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:48.223
gathered outside the hall of governance
to petition that she be punished.

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:52.519
Are you saying
that is why he went on a hunt?

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:56.189
Not a single day goes by quietly
because of her.

00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:59.318
Your Royal Highness,
you should teach her a lesson

00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:01.236
and show your authority…

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.863
Is it truly just because of that?

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.491
Could it be that His Majesty remembers

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:10.078
{\an8}what happened to the deposed queen?

00:22:11.204 --> 00:22:15.584
I believe she died
around this time of year.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.920
Therefore, the late king's…

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:21.423
{\an8}This is unacceptable.

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.842
{\an8}Hunting on the day of the gusikrye?

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:26.219
{\an8}This is truly lamentable.

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.889
{\an8}He knows it is an important ritual
for the nation,

00:22:28.972 --> 00:22:31.391
and yet he chose to go hunting.

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:34.644
Is it not obvious?

00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:40.567
{\an8}Someone must have done or said something
to upset His Majesty.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:46.907
I wonder what could have
hurt him this time.

00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:49.618
You reek of alcohol.

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.453
Did you drink until morning again?

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:52.621
Morning?

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.665
Is it still the morning?

00:22:55.749 --> 00:22:58.960
Well, I did drink
right until I came into the palace.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.840
But tell me.

00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:07.552
Why is that Chief Royal Secretary Im
nowhere to be seen?

00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:09.346
{\an8}He left for yet another round of chaehong.

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:10.388
{\an8}CHAEHONG: THE SELECTION OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
AND HORSES DURING YEONHUIGUN'S REIGN

00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:13.225
{\an8}Our nation is truly becoming a mess,
Your Highness.

00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:14.810
The state of our nation

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:18.730
is just as messed up as the skirt hem

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:20.732
of a lecherous woman.

00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:26.988
The ritual is still underway.

00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:29.825
Who is speaking so loudly?

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:30.992
Be quiet.

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.369
Be quiet, everyone.

00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:36.623
Help His Majesty lead the nation

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:39.960
with virtue and wisdom.

00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:45.340
The daytime birds call,
yet the sky is dark.

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:47.050
There truly is an eclipse.

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:54.808
Where did Chief Royal Secretary
Im Song-jae go for the chaehong?

00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:56.977
The Gyeonggi Governor's Office,
Your Majesty.

00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:04.609
Heed my words.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.612
After the hunt, I will head
to the Gyeonggi Governor's Office.

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:09.698
Whoever kills the most deer

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.325
will receive a special award today!

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:19.416
Let us hunt!

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:22.961
Your Majesty, there is a problem.

00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:25.255
What is it?

00:24:26.047 --> 00:24:28.008
Are you also concerned about the gusikrye?

00:24:28.091 --> 00:24:30.051
Yes, I am.

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:34.097
Hunting during an eclipse
is a rare enjoyment.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.850
And it has only just gotten exciting.

00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:39.227
However, they say that if the king
misses the ritual,

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.687
he may anger the heavens,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.316
and a gwinyeo, female ghost, may appear.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.779
A gwinyeo…

00:24:59.372 --> 00:25:00.957
What is happening?

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:08.089
I do not believe in the supernatural
or the unexplainable.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.052
A gwinyeo in the age of Neo-Confucianism?

00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:35.992
Why do I smell phytoncide?

00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:50.382
Wait.

00:25:51.007 --> 00:25:52.259
What the heck is this net?

00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:54.636
What is this? Why am I in a net?

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:55.595
What's going on?

00:25:56.179 --> 00:25:59.140
Hello? Is anyone out there?

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.225
Hello?

00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:02.644
What the heck is happening?

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.153
What the heck? There's no signal?

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:14.447
This is a catastrophe.

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.206
Damn it.

00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:31.089
I'm in here!

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:34.467
I swear I was in the bathroom
on the plane.

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:37.345
What happened?

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:40.348
What's going on?

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:45.895
It's a fox!

00:26:47.647 --> 00:26:48.606
Go after it!

00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:50.483
Your Majesty!

00:26:57.032 --> 00:26:58.116
Your Majesty!

00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:01.036
Your Majesty!

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:08.793
Damn it! Why is 5G speed so crap?

00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:12.422
Is there no service
because I'm up in the mountains?

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:16.509
Jeez, my arm.

00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:20.847
Where on earth am I?

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.807
What country am I even in?

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:29.439
An arrow?

00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:37.781
A fox?

00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:45.121
Oh, my back.

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:51.294
I'm right here, you know!

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.713
What the heck?

00:27:54.297 --> 00:27:55.632
Goodness gracious.

00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:56.674
They must be crazy.

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:59.010
You're shooting at a person!

00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:01.554
Stop aiming this way! Don't shoot!

00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:03.431
The fox went that way!

00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:20.031
Who are you?

00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:21.783
Are you Korean?

00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:28.164
A suspicious being.

00:28:31.918 --> 00:28:33.628
No. Wait.

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:35.964
The fox went that way.

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:38.133
Don't shoot.

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.217
What are you doing?

00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:55.024
Why is he chasing me?

00:28:56.651 --> 00:28:57.861
Don't follow me!

00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:04.868
Oh my gosh!

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.230
This is Korea, right?

00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:35.982
And you shot the arrows, right?

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.276
Who are you?

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:42.071
She looks rather strange,

00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:43.740
from her hair to her attire.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.994
Is that a silver dagger in her hand?

00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:53.333
Judging by the way he spoke,
this definitely is Korea.

00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:56.628
Is he a cosplayer?

00:29:58.213 --> 00:29:59.422
Why is he in a hanbok?

00:30:00.256 --> 00:30:03.593
Shouldn't you introduce yourself first
if you want to know who I am?

00:30:03.676 --> 00:30:07.305
I kept yelling that the fox went that way.
Didn't you hear me?

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:08.223
I did.

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.265
What?

00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.811
Then why did you keep shooting at me?
Are you crazy?

00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:17.524
No, stop! Wait!

00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:18.983
Who are you?

00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:20.944
This shoots 10,000 volts.

00:30:21.027 --> 00:30:23.321
You know what a stun gun is, don't you?

00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:28.159
It stuns?

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:30.745
They say that if the king
misses the ritual,

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:32.789
he may anger the heavens,

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:35.542
and a gwinyeo, female ghost, may appear.

00:30:36.125 --> 00:30:38.419
Could she be a gwinyeo?

00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:41.965
Are you human or a ghost?

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.843
Or are you a nine-tailed fox?

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:46.553
What kind of reaction is this?

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:49.055
I'm just a person.

00:30:49.138 --> 00:30:50.807
You wicked thing.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.934
Who would call you "just a person"?

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:55.353
You crazy…

00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:56.688
No, wait.

00:30:57.981 --> 00:30:59.190
Listen. Okay, fine.

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:01.526
I'm not just any person.

00:31:01.609 --> 00:31:04.112
I'm a three-star Michelin chef.

00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:05.738
"Chef"?

00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:08.700
The strange attire, frivolous speech,

00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:10.743
and a look that shows you do not
understand a word I am saying.

00:31:10.827 --> 00:31:12.954
You are most definitely a gwinyeo.

00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:17.292
A beggar ghost.

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.085
What's wrong with this punk?

00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:20.837
I can't take this anymore.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.090
What did you say?
Fine. I admit that I look like a beggar.

00:31:24.173 --> 00:31:26.885
I landed in a forest,
so my clothes got dirty.

00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:29.387
But do you think you look normal?

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:31.806
What did you say? "You"?

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.808
How dare you address me in that manner?

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:37.186
What else should I call you then?
I can't call you "me," can I?

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.525
Oh, wait. Are you an actor?

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:44.527
Are you filming a historical drama?

00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:46.362
You must be in the middle of a shoot.

00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:47.363
Is it a movie? A drama?

00:31:47.447 --> 00:31:49.407
Of all the things you are saying,

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.284
there is not a single word

00:31:52.118 --> 00:31:53.077
I am able to comprehend.

00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:57.749
Are you seriously out of your mind?
You can't aim at a person!

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.501
All right, shoot me.

00:32:01.127 --> 00:32:01.961
Go ahead.

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:11.596
My handbag.

00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:12.597
What the heck?

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.016
Did he actually shoot at me?

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:18.144
My hand

00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:20.229
must have trembled.

00:32:21.898 --> 00:32:23.232
Freeze!

00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:26.486
You. Get off that horse. Now!

00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:28.696
You know,

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:32.200
I have a black belt in taekwondo.

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.576
You're dead meat.

00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:37.830
Come at me, gwinyeo.

00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:46.005
Taekwon!

00:32:48.841 --> 00:32:49.801
Taekwon!

00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:56.766
Taekwon!

00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:04.273
Oh dear. You're out of arrows.

00:33:04.357 --> 00:33:06.985
I'll report you to the police

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:09.112
and have you locked up
for attempted murder, okay?

00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:12.532
My cousin's husband's
uncle's nephew-in-law

00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:14.784
is a lawyer who used to be a prosecutor.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.836
- Wait.
- Your cousin's husband's

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:26.921
uncle's nephew-in-law?

00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.090
That is practically a stranger, is it not?

00:33:32.051 --> 00:33:33.469
Oh my.

00:33:34.053 --> 00:33:35.888
You had a sword, huh?

00:33:36.472 --> 00:33:40.268
I do not know which administrative office
he belongs to,

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:41.519
but he will also…

00:33:44.063 --> 00:33:45.773
soon lose his head.

00:33:49.485 --> 00:33:51.487
Don't come any closer!

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:22.351
My stun gun!

00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:23.936
A gwinyeo's silver dagger.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.855
How could you?

00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:27.523
It did nothing but spark.

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:32.987
This has to be a dream.

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:34.530
If it is, please let me wake up.

00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:37.241
Where did all that bravado go?

00:34:37.825 --> 00:34:38.951
God, Buddha.

00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:41.871
I swear to be good. Hallelujah, amen.

00:34:41.954 --> 00:34:43.372
Now, I will let you go

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:45.666
to the afterlife.

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.586
Homage to the Amitabha Buddha!

00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:01.599
A rebel?

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.398
Oh no!

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.339
Your Majesty!

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:41.556
Your Majesty!

00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:48.938
His Majesty has disappeared.

00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:52.275
Search every corner of the forest!

00:35:52.358 --> 00:35:53.317
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:02.577
Make way!

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.579
Lord Im is passing through!

00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:11.544
I cannot stand them.

00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:14.213
You would think
it was His Majesty passing through.

00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:15.506
Im Song-jae

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.258
became the chief royal secretary
even after marrying a princess,

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:19.218
and now his power has reached a new high.

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:20.928
IM SEO-HONG, IM SONG-JAE

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.388
Son.

00:36:22.471 --> 00:36:24.557
Have you taken care of it?

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:28.936
I said one thing to the kitchen maids
at the Gyeonggi Governor's Office.

00:36:29.645 --> 00:36:31.314
"Run away if you wish to live."

00:36:31.898 --> 00:36:35.067
Even so, do not assume
things will go smoothly.

00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:38.029
Gyeonggi Governor Hong Gyeong-dal

00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:41.032
is an uptight old man
who believes Fourth Junior Consort Kang

00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:44.994
manipulates His Majesty
and sends endless letters of appeal.

00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:46.829
Father?

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:49.457
I will take care of everything, Father.

00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:51.667
So do not worry and let us go, Father.

00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:11.938
Oh my gosh!

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.279
Right, we fell together.

00:37:24.158 --> 00:37:25.493
A rebel?

00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:35.253
Wait. He was shot by an actual arrow?

00:37:36.545 --> 00:37:37.713
He was.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.676
Wait, hang on.

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:43.135
Hello?

00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:45.012
Is anyone here?

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:46.889
Someone's injured!

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:53.354
Hey.

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:55.231
Hey, wake up.

00:37:55.815 --> 00:37:56.816
How dare you?

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:59.652
Dare me, dare you. You need to wake up!

00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:01.112
Darn it.

00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:04.865
Blood!

00:38:08.744 --> 00:38:10.955
Right, let's stop the bleeding.

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:25.511
I should have an ointment somewhere.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.557
Here it is.

00:38:30.766 --> 00:38:33.311
I'll use a good dollop of this on you.

00:38:34.353 --> 00:38:36.230
No matter how crazy you are,

00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:38.941
I can't just leave a patient out to die.

00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:44.572
Right, 911.

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:51.329
My phone's in my handbag.

00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:54.498
I don't want to touch him.

00:38:55.082 --> 00:38:56.876
I'm going to check your pockets.

00:38:57.376 --> 00:38:58.252
Okay?

00:38:58.336 --> 00:38:59.545
Where's his phone?

00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:04.383
Why are there no pockets?

00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:07.595
Is it on this side?

00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:11.724
Are you looking for this?

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:14.977
Oh jeez!

00:39:15.061 --> 00:39:18.022
I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

00:39:18.105 --> 00:39:20.941
I was looking for your phone
to call for help

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.151
because you seemed badly hurt.

00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:26.072
I don't have my phone with me
because you shot my handbag!

00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:27.114
What?

00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:28.908
How dare you!

00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:30.701
Are you trying to trap me
with your strange words again

00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:31.994
so you can have someone shoot at me?

00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:33.954
You're paranoid.

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:36.624
Being at the scene of an accident
doesn't mean I caused it!

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:38.751
You cannot talk your way out!

00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:41.504
The State Tribunal will reveal
who is behind all this.

00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:43.672
Stay calm, Yeon Ji-young.

00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:45.549
You crazy fool!

00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:47.676
Don't you see
that I stopped the bleeding for you?

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.512
I saved your life!

00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:52.515
She stopped the bleeding?

00:39:52.598 --> 00:39:54.016
If that is true,

00:39:55.017 --> 00:39:57.686
you must have kept me alive for a reason.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.648
I saved your life, and this is what I get?

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.358
Let's make one thing clear.

00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:05.861
However unstable you may be,
I'm not interested in taking your life!

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:09.281
Stop all the nonsense and die, gwinyeo!

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.875
Hand over the dagger this instant!

00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:21.419
Forget it.

00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:23.546
I'm leaving, so don't follow me, okay?

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:25.673
Halt!

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.591
I command you as the King of Joseon!

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.305
"King"? Just be quiet.

00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:34.932
Don't say a thing, okay?

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:38.602
What a weirdo.

00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:41.897
My words are not
getting through to her, are they?

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.407
I'm pretty good with a knife too.

00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:03.669
She is quite extraordinary with a knife.

00:41:19.059 --> 00:41:19.935
Did you see that?

00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:21.854
Is she truly a gwinyeo?

00:41:30.946 --> 00:41:32.740
Tell me your name, gwinyeo.

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:33.866
"Ginyeo"? As in courtesan?

00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:37.786
I'm not a courtesan!
I'm just an ordinary person!

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:39.038
A person?

00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:40.831
If so, who is your father?

00:41:40.915 --> 00:41:43.459
Damn it. You're just hopeless!

00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:45.085
The "Damn" family?

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.130
You've got to be kidding me right now.

00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:49.882
I'm a chef!

00:41:49.965 --> 00:41:51.842
I'm Chef Yeon Ji-young!

00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:52.927
"Chef"?

00:41:53.427 --> 00:41:55.513
I have never heard of
a Yeon family from Chef in my life.

00:41:59.266 --> 00:42:01.268
Who in the world are you?

00:42:02.561 --> 00:42:03.562
A cook!

00:42:03.646 --> 00:42:05.397
I'm a cook!

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:52.444
All done.

00:42:53.696 --> 00:42:54.780
Man, that was tiring.

00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:10.254
Let's see.

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.259
Hey.

00:43:16.051 --> 00:43:17.094
Hey, you.

00:43:32.818 --> 00:43:33.777
What is this?

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.864
Did you tie me up?

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.199
Don't try to get smart with me
and stand up.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:42.036
Do you have a death wish?

00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:45.331
Do you not get the situation right now?

00:43:46.874 --> 00:43:49.001
Get up, or I'm going on my own.

00:43:57.384 --> 00:43:58.469
Fine.

00:44:05.517 --> 00:44:06.518
Lead the way.

00:44:07.102 --> 00:44:10.481
Unbelievable.
How is everything you say an order?

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.404
Try to keep up.

00:44:21.283 --> 00:44:24.203
How far are you going to take me
to kill me?

00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:25.496
Seriously!

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:29.124
Will you stop with that nonsense already?

00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:32.169
If I wanted you dead,
I wouldn't have saved you.

00:44:32.252 --> 00:44:35.464
You tied me up, yet you are acting
like you did me a favor.

00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:41.512
So you acknowledge
that I was trying to save you, right?

00:44:41.595 --> 00:44:43.597
I acknowledge
that you were not trying to kill me.

00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:46.141
Do you also acknowledge
that I'm not a ginyeo?

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.227
I never said "ginyeo."

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.354
I said "gwinyeo," as in female ghost.

00:44:50.437 --> 00:44:52.356
I don't believe this.

00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:55.275
Let's go.

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:57.111
Come along.

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.237
Let's go.

00:44:59.113 --> 00:45:00.155
Come on, let's go!

00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:05.994
{\an8}BONGDEOKGUNG

00:45:06.078 --> 00:45:07.413
{\an8}What happened?

00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:09.706
{\an8}What do you mean
His Majesty has not yet returned?

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:14.086
{\an8}It seems he is enjoying the hunt
and delaying his return.

00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:15.087
{\an8}CHU-WOL
INSPECTOR COURT LADY

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.213
No.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.008
He may love hunting,
but this has never happened before.

00:45:22.344 --> 00:45:24.221
Something bad must have happened.

00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:25.931
Is that it?

00:45:26.765 --> 00:45:28.642
Did His Highness make a move?

00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.229
{\an8}7 YEARS AGO

00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:34.606
{\an8}Do you know who I am?

00:45:41.655 --> 00:45:44.658
I first noticed you
at the courtesan house.

00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:49.663
It was even before you had become
a fully fledged courtesan.

00:45:50.372 --> 00:45:54.168
I heard your mother
sold you to Scholar Yi.

00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:57.629
Did you really kill him?

00:45:58.922 --> 00:45:59.756
Yes.

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.051
Every day must have been hell,

00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:07.723
putting up with endless beatings by day

00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:10.142
and taking that beast of a man by night.

00:46:10.225 --> 00:46:13.187
But to a woman living on this land,

00:46:13.979 --> 00:46:15.314
that is an everyday occurrence.

00:46:16.565 --> 00:46:17.441
So what?

00:46:18.317 --> 00:46:21.195
Are you saying it is only natural for us
to live like animals?

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.988
If I had to go back to living like that,

00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:25.324
I would kill him again.

00:46:32.706 --> 00:46:33.874
I will

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.210
get you out of here.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.005
What do you want from me?

00:46:49.264 --> 00:46:50.432
Do you desire

00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:53.894
to enjoy a night with me before I die?

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.103
Do you also think

00:46:56.522 --> 00:46:58.398
I am just one of those shallow men?

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.943
What I want

00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:03.153
is not for you to be my woman.

00:47:04.363 --> 00:47:05.739
I want your loyalty.

00:47:06.448 --> 00:47:09.826
I may have killed a damned nobleman today,

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.413
but I may become a dangerous sword aimed
at your neck tomorrow, Your Highness.

00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:23.882
How can you kill a man
who is already dead?

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.093
I died

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.554
ten years ago.

00:47:36.937 --> 00:47:40.357
He is waiting for the right time.
He would not act so rashly.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.485
- Chu-wol.
- Yes, Your Grace.

00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:45.904
I must send an urgent message
to His Highness.

00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:48.865
Very well.

00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:54.830
Your Highness, an urgent message
has arrived from the palace.

00:48:00.335 --> 00:48:01.837
His Majesty

00:48:03.088 --> 00:48:05.465
has not yet returned to the palace.

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:08.343
Was he attacked by another assassin?

00:48:08.427 --> 00:48:10.178
If that were the case,

00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:13.849
{\an8}a victim of the Muin Literati Purge
would be behind it.

00:48:13.932 --> 00:48:15.976
Who would dare act without our knowledge?

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.520
We do not know everyone.

00:48:18.604 --> 00:48:22.190
Countless people lost their masters,
friends, or brothers like we did.

00:48:22.274 --> 00:48:24.067
It is impossible to know
each and every one of those people.

00:48:25.944 --> 00:48:28.905
Even if someone did act on their own,

00:48:29.865 --> 00:48:31.992
we cannot condemn them for it.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:39.499
We have chosen to bide our time
for the right moment.

00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:43.128
Even if the current king is a tyrant,

00:48:44.546 --> 00:48:47.257
we must not test the times.

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.054
If one of us

00:48:53.472 --> 00:48:54.473
has indeed…

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:01.313
acted on their own,

00:49:03.148 --> 00:49:05.233
they will pay the price.

00:49:07.819 --> 00:49:08.654
Do not forget

00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:12.282
that it is our destiny
to wait for the time

00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:15.535
to rectify the world.

00:49:16.828 --> 00:49:18.455
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

00:49:37.391 --> 00:49:38.225
Water.

00:49:41.395 --> 00:49:42.521
Bring me water.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:45.941
Listen.

00:49:46.024 --> 00:49:47.984
I'm thirsty too.

00:49:48.068 --> 00:49:49.611
Go look for a tavern nearby.

00:49:50.195 --> 00:49:51.822
I need a cup of cinnamon punch.

00:49:52.739 --> 00:49:54.408
This is just unbelievable.

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.660
Are you a die-hard fan or something?

00:49:57.411 --> 00:49:59.913
You think you're actually
a Joseon king or what?

00:50:00.455 --> 00:50:01.665
I see you finally get it.

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:04.793
I am the king of this country.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.008
Did you hurt your head and not your chest?

00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:17.055
I guess you do not want to believe it.

00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:25.313
- Look closely.
- Oh jeez.

00:50:25.397 --> 00:50:27.232
What do you want me to look at now?

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.695
What now?

00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:40.120
What is this?

00:50:40.746 --> 00:50:42.164
Is this a dragon?

00:50:43.957 --> 00:50:46.918
Oh, so you're saying this is proof
that you're the king.

00:50:47.002 --> 00:50:48.670
My gosh.

00:50:48.754 --> 00:50:50.297
This is just sad.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.673
You can rent robes like this

00:50:51.757 --> 00:50:53.550
for three hours for 10,000 won
at Bongdeokgung.

00:50:53.633 --> 00:50:55.469
- You really think I'd fall for that?
- What?

00:50:56.303 --> 00:50:57.929
They are renting out my royal robes
at the palace?

00:50:58.013 --> 00:51:00.682
Yes. People dress up
to tour the palace grounds.

00:51:00.766 --> 00:51:02.267
Foreigners love it.

00:51:05.604 --> 00:51:09.149
Why will you not believe
that I am the king?

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:10.525
Then what about you?

00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:13.653
Why will you not believe I am a chef?

00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:15.322
You are unbelievably frustrating.

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:17.032
What will you do if I really am the king?

00:51:17.115 --> 00:51:20.160
You're a patient,
so I'll try to be understanding.

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:23.580
Go.

00:51:25.165 --> 00:51:25.999
Go.

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.250
Come on.

00:51:28.794 --> 00:51:29.628
Fine.

00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:35.050
You are not the woman of my taste,

00:51:35.133 --> 00:51:37.427
but once we return to the palace,

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:40.096
I will grant you a royal favor.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:43.308
I will grant you a royal favor.

00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:47.854
You'll do what? Grant a royal favor?

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:50.482
There are things you just shouldn't say,
no matter how crazy you are!

00:51:50.565 --> 00:51:52.859
How dare you lay a hand on me?

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:55.237
I was too flustered to speak up earlier,

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.405
but I tend to get rough
when I hear rude nonsense.

00:51:57.489 --> 00:52:00.158
Silence! Do you call that an excuse?

00:52:00.242 --> 00:52:02.285
I don't believe this.

00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:04.663
Who in the world are you?

00:52:04.746 --> 00:52:05.705
Are you really an actor?

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:06.748
I am…

00:52:08.416 --> 00:52:09.668
the king…

00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:13.964
of this country.

00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:17.968
You really are a persistent one,
aren't you?

00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:19.386
That's enough.

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:23.306
Keep walking while I'm still willing
to put up with you.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:24.516
Go.

00:52:27.769 --> 00:52:28.645
Go.

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:32.315
It's a house!

00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:35.151
Thank goodness.

00:52:39.114 --> 00:52:40.198
Hey!

00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:43.285
Will you slow down?

00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:48.957
I know it's a small thatched house,

00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.751
but you can't just kick down
someone else's gate like that.

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:54.629
Everything on this land belongs to me.

00:52:57.424 --> 00:52:59.050
Why do I even bother?

00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:00.886
Goodness.

00:53:04.806 --> 00:53:06.016
{\an8}FORBIDDEN

00:53:07.642 --> 00:53:08.727
Hello?

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:11.771
Excuse me. Is anyone home?

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.231
Be quiet.

00:53:13.315 --> 00:53:16.026
{\an8}We are still within the geumpyo.

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:17.569
{\an8}"Geumpyo"?

00:53:17.652 --> 00:53:19.738
Yes. This is Salgoji Forest,
my hunting grounds,

00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:21.907
so no one lives here.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.158
Geumpyo…

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.412
I remember. Yeonhuigun.

00:53:27.495 --> 00:53:29.748
What? "Yeonhuigun"?

00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:32.250
Geumpyo, as in the prohibition signs.

00:53:34.502 --> 00:53:36.713
Yeonhuigun tore down houses
and kicked people out

00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:40.467
to clear space for his hunting grounds
and marked the boundary with the signs.

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:43.261
Who on earth is this Yeonhuigun?

00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:45.722
There is no member of the royal family
I do not know of.

00:53:45.805 --> 00:53:48.183
I thought you said you were a king.

00:53:49.142 --> 00:53:50.644
You don't know the tyrant Yeonhuigun?

00:53:51.853 --> 00:53:53.730
He sent treacherous subjects
as chaehong inspectors

00:53:53.813 --> 00:53:58.151
to bring in all the women in Joseon
to offer him.

00:53:58.234 --> 00:53:59.653
You really don't know him?

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.529
"Chaehong"?

00:54:02.155 --> 00:54:04.574
You are not talking about me, are you?

00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:07.619
Of course not. He lived centuries ago.

00:54:08.119 --> 00:54:11.665
Also, Yeonhuigun was a king.

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:12.916
The worst tyrant of Joseon.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.377
Why is he a tyrant?

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.712
You really don't know?

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:19.839
He ruled as he pleased,

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:22.467
tormented his people
to make his hunting grounds,

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.427
and had all the women
brought to him through the chaehong.

00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:27.889
Beheading disloyal subjects
and establishing authority

00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:29.349
is how you set the country right.

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:32.060
The people who lived
on the hunting grounds were relocated,

00:54:32.143 --> 00:54:34.020
and the chaehong serves a noble purpose.

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:36.022
You should try to understand
his intentions,

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:37.857
instead of rudely calling him a tyrant.

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:39.109
And what? Treacherous subjects?

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:42.988
Why are you so worked up
when it's not even about you?

00:54:43.697 --> 00:54:45.782
Let's be honest though.

00:54:45.865 --> 00:54:48.243
Forget the rest,
but that chaehong thing is just wrong.

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.120
How can a person do such a thing?

00:54:50.203 --> 00:54:52.789
Listen carefully, gwinyeo of Chef.

00:54:52.872 --> 00:54:55.333
You're calling me that again.

00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:56.334
A king's greatest duty

00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:59.963
is to ensure an heir and preserve
the royal lineage and kingdom.

00:55:00.046 --> 00:55:02.340
How could you condemn a king
who bestows his favor on all those women

00:55:02.424 --> 00:55:05.552
and the loyal subjects
who uphold his noble intentions?

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:09.681
You're insane.

00:55:09.764 --> 00:55:11.349
Studying history
must've messed with your mind.

00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:14.144
That heir nonsense is just an excuse.

00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:15.687
He was just crazy about women.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.398
- What an excuse.
- What? "Crazy about women"?

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:20.942
How dare you run your mouth like that?

00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:22.402
Sure, sure.

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:25.655
You can have all the heirs you want.

00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:28.033
I'm going to do what I'm about to do
for my peace of mind.

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:30.243
I have no interest…

00:55:32.245 --> 00:55:33.955
in men like you.

00:55:34.748 --> 00:55:37.292
Do you not fear the consequences?

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:42.756
No, Your Majesty.
I live like there is no tomorrow.

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:43.840
How dare you!

00:55:43.923 --> 00:55:45.341
Untie me this instant!

00:55:46.384 --> 00:55:48.386
I will not untie you this instant!

00:55:51.556 --> 00:55:52.474
What?

00:55:52.557 --> 00:55:54.851
Untie me immediately!

00:56:00.106 --> 00:56:02.025
I was so uncomfortable
in these damp clothes.

00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:03.193
Those are perfect.

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:18.333
Oh my gosh, I'm aching all over.

00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:22.212
What a weird day this has been.

00:56:22.962 --> 00:56:23.797
Right?

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:28.426
I should be saying that.

00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:35.100
Did you hear that?

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:37.727
I did.

00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:42.649
Is someone here?

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.284
Hello?

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:56.329
Is someone there?

00:57:00.375 --> 00:57:01.584
Hello?

00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:08.591
Where the heck is the light switch?
It's so dark.

00:57:09.717 --> 00:57:10.927
Is anyone here?

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.304
Hello?

00:57:14.055 --> 00:57:15.348
You thief!

00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:17.976
Did your father not teach you better?

00:57:18.059 --> 00:57:19.561
What? Thief?

00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:22.230
You clearly stole my clothes,
yet you deny it?

00:57:24.232 --> 00:57:26.317
Oh, these are your clothes?

00:57:26.401 --> 00:57:27.527
I'm sorry.

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:28.570
Forget it.

00:57:28.653 --> 00:57:30.530
- Just hurry up and get out of here.
- Okay, I will.

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:32.115
I'll leave.

00:57:33.366 --> 00:57:35.869
But before I do, where are we?

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.287
What neighborhood are we in?

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.455
I said forget it. Get out.

00:57:39.038 --> 00:57:40.999
- Hurry up and get out!
- Wait!

00:57:41.082 --> 00:57:43.334
- Get out!
- Hang on!

00:57:43.418 --> 00:57:44.419
Stop it!

00:57:46.754 --> 00:57:47.922
What is it with today?

00:57:49.424 --> 00:57:51.092
It just doesn't end, does it?

00:57:54.679 --> 00:57:55.638
Okay.

00:57:56.723 --> 00:57:58.016
Listen.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.019
I get why you'd misunderstand
the situation right now.

00:58:01.102 --> 00:58:03.480
But it was dark,
I didn't know where I was,

00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:05.440
and I saw a house and just came in.

00:58:05.523 --> 00:58:07.984
Do you expect me to believe that?

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:12.197
If that were the case, should you not have
called out for the owner first?

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:14.199
I did, but no one answered.

00:58:14.282 --> 00:58:15.658
That's why I thought
it was an empty house.

00:58:15.742 --> 00:58:18.077
What if it were an empty house?

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.829
Does that mean
you can put on someone else's clothes

00:58:19.913 --> 00:58:22.165
and go about like you own the place?

00:58:22.248 --> 00:58:24.626
This whole place is Salgoji Forest.

00:58:24.709 --> 00:58:27.253
So how can you not know where you are?

00:58:28.129 --> 00:58:29.672
You call this place Salgoji Forest too?

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.549
That's not what I'm asking.

00:58:32.258 --> 00:58:35.428
What region are we in?

00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:38.515
You are in no position
to raise your voice!

00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:41.476
This is the king's hunting grounds,

00:58:41.559 --> 00:58:43.269
and we could get dragged away
if we get caught.

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.063
Do you really not know about the geumpyo?

00:58:45.146 --> 00:58:47.398
"The king"? "Geumpyo"?

00:58:47.482 --> 00:58:49.734
We are still within the geumpyo.

00:58:49.817 --> 00:58:52.946
This is Salgoji Forest,
my hunting grounds, so no one lives here.

00:58:55.573 --> 00:58:57.158
This is driving me insane.

00:58:57.659 --> 00:59:00.745
Everyone here acts like
they're from another country.

00:59:02.121 --> 00:59:04.374
Wait a second.
You're wearing a hanbok too.

00:59:06.668 --> 00:59:09.087
This is some kind of set, isn't it?

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:10.630
"Set"?

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:11.965
What is that?

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:14.008
A place where they film movies and dramas.

00:59:14.092 --> 00:59:16.928
What did you say? "Moose"? "Drums"?

00:59:17.011 --> 00:59:20.682
Come on, don't mess around with me.
You're scaring me.

00:59:20.765 --> 00:59:23.726
I am the one who is scared right now!

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.437
There's no way what he said was true,

00:59:26.521 --> 00:59:28.856
and I'm really in the Joseon Dynasty.

00:59:30.483 --> 00:59:33.444
Can you tell me what year this is?

00:59:33.528 --> 00:59:34.696
The year?

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.531
Let me see.

00:59:36.614 --> 00:59:39.033
It was the Year of the Black Sheep
last year,

00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:40.827
so this year
is the Year of the Blue Monkey.

00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.412
Year of the Blue Monkey?!

00:59:42.495 --> 00:59:43.913
What is the matter now?

00:59:43.997 --> 00:59:46.040
They're using the Heavenly Stems
to count the years?

00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:47.667
No way.

00:59:48.668 --> 00:59:49.836
Where did you say…

00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:52.005
we are?

00:59:53.464 --> 00:59:55.633
You are quite the strange one.

00:59:55.717 --> 00:59:58.553
You do not know that we are inside
the geumpyo of Salgoji Forest in Ttukseom,

00:59:58.636 --> 01:00:00.805
and you do not know what year it is.

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:04.058
Someone would think
you were from another world.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.852
Where is…

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:09.814
the nearest convenience store?

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.232
Convi… What?

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:14.235
What kind of strange word is that?

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.570
What did you say?

01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:18.489
Oh, a supermarket.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:21.284
Soup… What?

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:23.661
Oh dear.

01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:26.748
She doesn't know what a convenience store
or a supermarket is.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.125
There's no way.

01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:30.918
This must be a dream.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:40.553
How can I be hungry when I'm dreaming?

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.097
To be honest,

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.141
I am a bit hungry.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:47.435
Would you like something to eat?

01:00:47.518 --> 01:00:50.229
Is this not a dream?

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.899
Goodness me. Do not be silly.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.109
Hurry up and get up, will you?

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.364
I need to find my handbag first.

01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:02.700
My phone's in it,
so I can figure something out then.

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.247
After we've had something to eat,

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.541
will you take me to a cliff nearby?

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:12.502
To a cliff?

01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:14.754
At this hour?

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:18.800
I lost something,
and I really need to get it back.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:23.262
There is only one cliff nearby.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.306
What is there to eat here?

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.141
I'll cook for you.

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:33.856
Goodness.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:41.698
Who is he?

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.452
What? He fell asleep so quickly.

01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:50.289
Let's go. Where do we go?

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.417
Just follow me.

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:54.752
Oh my.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.965
- Is this omija?
- Yes, it is.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.592
Oh, it's bracken. Did you dry these?

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:04.470
Yes. I harvested and dried them all.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.222
No way. This is dongchimi,
radish water kimchi.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:10.685
That is delicious.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.272
One, two, three.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:29.412
By the way, what's your name?

01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:30.538
It is Gil-geum.

01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:34.375
- Seo Gil-geum.
- My name is Yeon Ji-young.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:35.585
How old are you?

01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:36.711
I am 18 years old.

01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:38.296
Oh, I'm older.

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:39.839
I'll speak casually, if that's okay.

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:40.965
Sure.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.009
There.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.934
Using firewood is one thing,

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:54.061
but there's no electronic rice cooker,

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.813
and there are no lights either.

01:02:56.689 --> 01:02:59.150
Is it even possible
that a place like this still exists?

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:02.278
Not to mention her.

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:06.616
Gil-geum, where did you find all this?

01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:10.286
People usually look for fruits or herbs
with their eyes.

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:12.538
But I do that with my nose.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.708
You have the nose of a dog, huh?

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.169
A heightened sense of smell.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:26.344
Barley rice and wild vegetables…

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:34.143
Right, I have those.

01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:43.319
They're here.

01:03:43.861 --> 01:03:44.946
I have them.

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:59.460
It's time to show them what I can do.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.216
This is a true natural, whole-food meal.

01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:45.172
The deep aroma.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.341
The smell of spring.

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:49.510
That is the smell of nature.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:52.555
- Is this enough rice?
- It's perfect.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:57.935
- What is that thing?
- All right.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:16.287
Miss, this smells like filbert.

01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:19.373
- Oh my.
- Oh, you mean hazelnuts?

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.500
{\an8}This is called beurre noisette.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:26.047
{\an8}If you burn butter, it turns brown
and gives off a nutty aroma.

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:30.927
If you use that instead of sesame oil,

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.679
you get a completely different bibimbap.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:36.641
This is too pretty to eat.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.059
It looks like a painting.

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:42.229
I should go and make some nureunggaengi.

01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:45.566
"Nureunggaengi"?

01:05:47.526 --> 01:05:49.111
Look at him.

01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:52.990
Hey. Wake up.

01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:56.827
How can you sleep so deeply?

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:59.622
It was only hours ago when you were
trying to kill me, calling me a gwinyeo.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.084
Here. Have some
before you go back to sleep.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.297
It is fine.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.842
You're sulking. Jeez, how petty.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.302
What?

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:15.012
"Petty"?

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.557
I'll be the bigger person. Here.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:21.894
Open your mouth.

01:06:23.896 --> 01:06:24.897
I am fine.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.568
Your body's asking for food.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.612
Come on, just have a bite.

01:06:33.864 --> 01:06:34.991
How can I trust you?

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:37.243
Hurry up. My arm hurts.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.328
If you insist,

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.706
{\an8}you taste it first.

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:43.374
{\an8}THE COURT LADY TASTES THE KING'S FOOD
TO CHECK FOR POISON

01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:44.917
{\an8}You want me to do what?

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:49.088
Goodness.

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.297
Hey, Gil-geum. Join us.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.634
It's fine.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.845
He's not a bad person.

01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:57.388
He's just troublesome.

01:06:57.471 --> 01:06:58.848
Come.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.184
Well, then…

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.813
Do excuse me, my lord.

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.524
He's not well.

01:07:08.607 --> 01:07:09.859
I hope you understand.

01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:12.236
Who are you?

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.363
Well…

01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:18.409
She's the owner of this house.
Her name is Seo Gil-geum.

01:07:18.492 --> 01:07:19.493
Say hello.

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:21.662
- Greetings.
- Shut it!

01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:23.956
No one owns land within the geumpyo.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.709
Oh, well, you see…

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:30.963
My gosh.

01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:33.382
Are you two shooting a movie or something?

01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:35.718
What's with you two?

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.220
Just forget it and dig in.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:39.555
It tastes best now.

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:41.766
I'll have a bite first.

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:48.647
It may look fancy,
but it is just barley rice.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:49.690
Come on.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:52.276
It's not just your ordinary barley rice.

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:56.405
This is gochujang butter bibimbap
made by a three-star Michelin chef.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:59.283
It's top-class French bibimbap.

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:01.535
"Fringe bibinbap"?

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.412
I used butter instead of sesame oil.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:06.040
It's much less spicy
than when you just use gochujang,

01:08:06.123 --> 01:08:07.625
and it has a richer flavor.

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:09.085
"Gochojang"?

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.628
"Batter"?

01:08:12.713 --> 01:08:13.756
Here.

01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:16.926
It looks like rice
mixed with other things.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:20.554
What did she use instead of soy sauce?

01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:23.182
What is that bright red thing?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.189
It was so worth
picking out the vegetables ourselves.

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.316
The aroma is beyond compare
with the ones at a supermarket.

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:47.456
It's good. Perfectly seasoned.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.626
Eat up, Gil-geum.

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:52.753
That fool will finish it all
if he changes his mind.

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:57.216
A lowly thing like me would not dare.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:02.680
{\an8}I see that at least you know
social order and manners.

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:04.849
"Social order"?

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:08.936
What's with the weird vibe?

01:09:09.019 --> 01:09:12.857
It feels as if
I actually traveled back in time.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:16.277
Oh, whatever.

01:09:17.778 --> 01:09:18.863
Here.

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:19.864
Open up.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.013
What do you think you are doing?

01:09:45.431 --> 01:09:47.099
You're such a handful.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.726
Are you going to eat or not?

01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:50.895
Grab a proper spoonful.

01:09:52.062 --> 01:09:54.481
Forget it. I don't care if you starve.

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:57.318
How can I eat it
if the spoon cannot even fit in my mouth?

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:01.572
I give up. You win.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:10.289
Oh, our dear princess,
is this little bite good enough for you?

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.666
- Here you go.
- What did you call me?

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:14.001
A princess?

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.796
Upon closer look,
you're actually a prince.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.256
Here you go, Your Highness.

01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:34.730
Well? It's good, isn't it?

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:40.402
Are you truly trying to kill…

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:41.820
What, you can't handle the spice?

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:43.739
Come on.

01:10:43.822 --> 01:10:46.033
Is it that spicy? It's not that bad.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.082
It's not spicy. It's delicious.

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:54.750
Try it.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.132
What kind of food is this?

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:06.136
- Is it spicy for you too?
- Yes! I am dying!

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:09.723
Tell me the truth.
What poison did you add to the food?

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:11.392
Despite the severely lacking situation,

01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:13.644
I made you bibimbap
with gochujang and butter,

01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:15.562
and that's what you say?

01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:18.232
Forget it. Don't eat.
I'll finish the rest.

01:11:18.315 --> 01:11:19.858
Wait, no.

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.026
I want more.

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:28.117
It was spicy and painful at first,
but what should I say?

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.077
Once the spiciness went away,

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.122
I could enjoy the flavors,
and it is rather addictive.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.374
- Right?
- Yes.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:38.961
It is the most delicious thing
I have ever tasted.

01:11:39.753 --> 01:11:42.423
I knew you'd recognize good food.

01:12:12.369 --> 01:12:13.704
Here.

01:12:28.927 --> 01:12:31.180
See? I knew it.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:34.141
It's good, isn't it?
It's delicious, right?

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:37.770
Do not put the spoon down.

01:12:40.564 --> 01:12:41.398
Here.

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:43.192
Open up.

01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:45.486
Open up.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:50.908
Is it tasty?

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.327
Yes, Mother.

01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:57.039
You should not skip your meals
just because your grandmother scolded you.

01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:58.123
DEPOSED QUEEN YEON
YI HEON'S BIRTH MOTHER

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.501
A king is one who fathoms.

01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:02.836
He must fathom his family,

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.588
the heavens,

01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:08.133
and the hearts of others.

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:11.720
Is it that spicy?

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.352
We finished the food.
Let's clean up, Gil-geum.

01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:19.353
Okay.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:24.108
Thanks.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.278
Let me.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:31.490
Would you like a bowl, my lord?

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.243
- It's okay. I don't think he'll drink it.
- Okay.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.203
Do we do the dishes here?

01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:37.413
It is over here.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:40.874
Is he crying because it is spicy?

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.293
It wasn't spicy enough to make you cry.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:44.586
How strange.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:47.297
She made me think of my mother

01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:49.967
with such a simple meal.

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:57.433
Look under every stone by the river!

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:58.600
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:04.690
This is ridiculous.
You said you had the nose of a dog.

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:07.693
Does it smell that bad?

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.612
I think it smells fine.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:15.409
Let's leave it out here to air
while we go out.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:18.787
This is my revenge.

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:27.087
Oh my.

01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:30.382
He looks normal when he's asleep.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:36.180
You take such good care of your husband.

01:14:37.055 --> 01:14:37.931
Don't be silly.

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:40.893
Gil-geum,
is that what you thought all this time?

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:42.561
Yes. Then why else--

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.896
It's not like that.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.607
- I'll explain on the way. Let's go.
- Okay.

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.694
Let's find my handbag first.

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:54.448
He's unwell. I think he hurt his head.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:06.460
The stream tells me
we're on the right path.

01:15:06.543 --> 01:15:08.045
What did I tell you?

01:15:08.128 --> 01:15:10.881
This is the only way to the cliff.

01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:16.887
Miss, would you like to wash out
the dirt in your hair?

01:15:18.138 --> 01:15:20.349
Can we? I do feel a bit gross.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.685
Oh, that's cold!

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.312
It's colder than I expected.

01:15:25.395 --> 01:15:26.438
Goodness me.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.483
You cannot call this cold.

01:15:29.566 --> 01:15:30.692
Watch me.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.196
Oh my, how refreshing!

01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:36.198
I'll just wash my hair.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.953
My gosh. This is so nice!

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.121
Your Majesty!

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:46.833
Are you unharmed?

01:15:47.834 --> 01:15:49.962
Do I look unharmed to you?

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.338
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:53.465
I will find and behead the band of rebels

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.676
and atone for failing to protect you,
Your Majesty.

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:11.608
Heed my words.

01:16:12.526 --> 01:16:15.654
There is a traitor nearby
who has humiliated me.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.739
- Find them.
- Yes, Your Majesty!

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:39.595
Miss.

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:40.679
Yeah?

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.514
Use this to dry your hair.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:43.640
Thank you.

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:50.230
I am sorry for mistaking you for a thief.

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.107
Don't be.

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:55.777
I walked into your home
and wore your clothes without asking.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.946
That is true.

01:16:59.823 --> 01:17:02.075
By the way, Gil-geum,
why do you live in hiding?

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.160
Isn't that your home?

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:07.748
I live here to avoid the chaehong.

01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:11.293
The chaehong serves a noble purpose.

01:17:12.919 --> 01:17:13.754
Chaehong?

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:15.505
Yes, chaehong.

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:16.923
Do you not know what that is?

01:17:17.507 --> 01:17:20.302
It is when they take all the women
to the palace.

01:17:20.385 --> 01:17:22.012
Do you truly not know?

01:17:22.095 --> 01:17:25.682
I do, but that happened
during the Joseon Dynasty.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:31.480
Where do you think you are
if not in Joseon?

01:17:31.563 --> 01:17:34.733
Are you saying
everything that fool said was true?

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:36.151
"That fool"?

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:39.279
Oh, the lord who is not well in the head?

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:42.491
So are you saying
this is the reign of Yeonhuigun?

01:17:43.241 --> 01:17:45.786
Who? "Yeoninggun"?

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.498
How do you know about chaehong
but not Yeonhuigun?

01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:52.334
I have never heard that name before.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:55.837
Who is down there?

01:17:57.047 --> 01:17:59.216
Hey, there are people.

01:18:00.717 --> 01:18:01.593
Over here!

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.710
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:18:36.628 --> 01:18:38.588
{\an8}Where are you from?

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:41.133
{\an8}I'm from 500 years in the future.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:45.137
{\an8}I see. I will not take your life today.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.723
{\an8}- Open this door!
- Miss!

01:18:48.765 --> 01:18:50.517
{\an8}Will you be able to complete a dish

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.520
{\an8}that will satisfy them
within the given time?

01:18:53.603 --> 01:18:56.148
{\an8}If we do this well, will you let us go?

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:57.858
{\an8}If what you say is true,

01:18:57.941 --> 01:18:59.651
{\an8}I will try it myself.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.486
{\an8}Do not just stand there.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.156
{\an8}Strike that criminal at once!

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.532
{\an8}I'm screwed.

01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:08.118
{\an8}He really was Yeonhuigun.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:19.171
