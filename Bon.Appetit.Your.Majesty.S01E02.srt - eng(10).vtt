00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.968
Hey, there are people.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.722
Over here! We're over here!

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.015
Who is down there?

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.516
- We're over--
- Miss!

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.684
What--

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.480
Why are you stopping me, Gil-geum?

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.439
Chaehong.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.316
What?

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.109
{\an8}Chaehong!

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.611
{\an8}CHAEHONG: THE SELECTION OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
AND HORSES DURING YEONHUIGUN'S REIGN

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:16.451
Wait, that's actually the chaehong
happening right now?

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:17.452
Yes.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.704
We might also get dragged away,

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.206
so follow me.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.000
This is unbelievable.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.461
After all I have been through
to hide from them,

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.505
there is no way
I am getting taken away like this.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:30.715
Where do you think
you are sneaking off to?

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.887
SEO GIL-GEUM
GIRL WITH HEIGHTENED SENSE OF SMELL

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.722
This is kidnapping!

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.352
This is a crime! Let us out right now!

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.062
- Miss!
- Be quiet!

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:48.066
- Mister!
- Please stop. Screaming will not help.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.235
Are you telling me to just keep quiet?

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.445
What is this place anyway?

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:53.947
A prison in the governor's office.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.199
We are here for the chaehong.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.661
This is just ridiculous!

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.955
You girls. Keep quiet.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.916
Can you not tell where we are
by the looks of it?

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.752
None of us wants or deserves to be here.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.295
- That is right.
- Yes.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.755
If you keep shouting,

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.174
I will sew your lips shut.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.635
You are here for the chaehong,
for goodness' sake.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.264
This can't be real.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.392
This is just unbelievable.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:23.977
Truly unbelievable.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.272
Why do you keep saying
that it is unbelievable?

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:34.320
This prison looks like
it would be in a folk village…

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.992
and everyone's wearing hanbok.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.078
This is so weird.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:44.539
Everything's so weird.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.916
What the…

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.628
Did I really land in Joseon?

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:51.838
Is this even possible?

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.298
Miss.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:57.552
Even if the sky falls in,
there is always a way out.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:00.555
We should try to stay strong.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.308
So this place…

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.561
is Joseon, right?

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.813
How many times must I tell you so?

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.319
- Open this door!
- Miss!

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.321
- Mister!
- What is all this ruckus?

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.197
Be quiet!

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.575
I'm not from here. Please let me go!

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:24.120
Oh my! What are you doing to her?

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:25.872
What do I do? Help!

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.626
Let me go! No!

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.295
Hey!

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.546
Hey!

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.423
Hey!

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:40.803
- I swear, you misters…
- Save us!

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.647
So I was right. I did travel back in time.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.234
What is this, a fantasy novel?
How could this even be possible?

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.526
What a surprise!

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.820
Madam Yeon Ji-young from Korea!

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.573
Congratulations! Please step forward!

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.452
{\an8}I'll be the head chef
of a Michelin three-star restaurant!

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.746
Well done. I'm so proud of you.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.207
DAD…

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:14.295
{\an8}I JUST GOT THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BECOME A HEAD CHEF…

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.508
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.718
WHY ON EARTH?

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:23.221
Oh, that's hot! "Mangunrok"?

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.472
What?

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.809
I'm right here, you know!

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:29.394
Who are you? Are you human or a ghost?

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.187
A rebel?

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:34.983
If this is the Joseon Dynasty

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.527
and what he said is true…

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.820
I see you finally get it.

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.154
I am the king of this country.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.239
Is this a dragon?

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.365
Fine.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.034
Once we return to the palace,

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.037
I will grant you a royal favor.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.082
Grant a royal favor?

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.042
He actually is the king?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.377
Everything on this land belongs to me.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.837
There is no member of the royal family
I do not know of.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.755
Who on earth is this Yeonhuigun?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.258
Is he Yeonhuigun?

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.562
First, I have to get out of here.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.064
I'll get out and find a way back somehow.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:16.733
What is happening?

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:18.484
Step outside.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.694
- Pardon?
- Sorry?

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.282
Where are we going?

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.993
Where are we going?

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.370
What do you think, my lord?

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.123
- Left.
- Go to the left.

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:33.958
Come here. Stand in front of us.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.296
- Look up. How old are you?
- I am 20.

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.674
- Gil-geum, what are they doing?
- Left.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:46.345
It looks like they are
dividing the women into two groups.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.639
The chaehong inspector must be coming.

00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:50.266
Chaehong inspector?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.727
Are you saying
I could become the king's woman?

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.187
You never know.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.690
That does not happen to just anyone
who is picked.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.568
This is driving me insane.

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.487
What a disaster.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.990
Miss, it is a disaster for everyone here.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.992
That's not what I mean.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.620
I'm not from here!

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:13.247
You think you can avoid the chaehong
if you are not from here?

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.707
That's not the point.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.666
Next.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.588
Why are you standing there? Step forward.

00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:22.256
Come on over.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:24.884
How old are you?

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.220
I'm 27.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:31.682
Left.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.977
- You are too old.
- What?

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.397
- He said you are too old.
- Next.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.067
Step forward.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.155
Why are you standing and gawping?

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.700
I am 30 years old.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.081
How insolent! You should not lie.

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:57.834
You look to be about 17.

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:02.213
Then what about 28?

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.214
Left.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:05.925
Next.

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:07.009
Go to the left.

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:09.137
Come on.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.267
Gil-geum.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.686
This is a relief, but for some reason…

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.313
I am a little insulted.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:24.610
Women on the right,
go to the annex and dress up.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:25.987
{\an8}Women on the left,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.573
{\an8}go to the chanbang
and help prepare the jeopbingaek.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:29.657
{\an8}- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.200
{\an8}"Chanbang"?

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.422
Your Majesty,
this was found by the stream.

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:51.387
Oh my gosh, I'm aching all over.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.183
What a weird day this has been.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.434
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:57.685
Was there anything else?

00:07:57.768 --> 00:07:58.978
Judging by the footprints of the guards,

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.730
it seems they were taken
to the governor's office.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:04.442
So it seems she walked right into it.

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:05.359
Let us go.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.819
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.446
To the Gyeonggi Governor's Office!

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.989
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:17.413
COURSE Nº 2 SOUS VIDE CUISINE

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.165
Get moving.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.797
{\an8}This place really looks just like
what I saw in the dramas.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.094
{\an8}This is real brassware.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.973
{\an8}- It's soy sauce.
- "Soy sauce"?

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:38.392
{\an8}It's rich.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.769
{\an8}Is this vinegar?

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.063
{\an8}- I think it's vinegar.
- Gosh, it is sour.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.400
{\an8}This is called "dunggumi."

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.528
{\an8}It is a basket used for storing grain
or vegetables.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:49.862
{\an8}"Dunggumi."

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.450
{\an8}A cast-iron brazier.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.078
They use this to cook meat or fish.

00:08:57.161 --> 00:08:58.496
This is quite rare.

00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:00.039
There's a gridiron too.

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:02.542
{\an8}- We call that "jeokcheol."
- "Jeokcheol."

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:03.459
{\an8}JEOKCHEOL: TOOL USED TO COOK MEAT AND FISH

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:05.586
{\an8}That's a beoseon-tip knife.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.712
{\an8}BEOSEON-TIP KNIFE:
A KNIFE SHAPED LIKE A POINTED SOCK

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.340
{\an8}The tip really points up and is sharp.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:12.677
Goodness me, how can you cook
when you do not know anything?

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.138
What are you two brats doing?

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.265
{\an8}Are you lolling about here?

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:19.892
{\an8}- "Lolling"?
- Hurry up and get to work!

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.144
Okay. Sorry.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.813
Miss, we should hurry up and get to work.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.483
- What can we--
- Gil-geum.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.237
Working fast won't get us anywhere.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.239
What does that mean?

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:41.664
What are you cooking?

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.708
Can you not tell?

00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:46.627
Look at this slippery thing.
I am cooking seaweed soup.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.136
Why are you cutting the radish?

00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:57.054
- To make radish soup.
- What?

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.599
But she's cooking seaweed soup over there.

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.268
- What?
- This has got to be a joke.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:06.939
Everyone, who told you to do
whatever you're doing?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.358
Would we be doing this if we knew?

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.278
{\an8}The kitchen maids ran away last night.

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:14.405
{\an8}Why did they leave?

00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:16.324
I have no idea.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.701
Why does that matter?

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:21.370
Are you going to stand there
and slack off?

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:25.583
We should at least know
who we're cooking for.

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:28.002
Does anyone know anything?

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:29.795
Do you know?

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:30.963
Do you?

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.173
No.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.354
- The shoot tips are fresh.
- They are.

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.230
Miss.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.359
There are not many ingredients,

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:54.654
but the ones remaining are pretty fresh.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.532
You're right.
It's not that they weren't prepared.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.410
The ingredients disappeared,

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.704
almost as if someone ran off with them.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:04.622
What?

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.211
Gather round, everyone.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.841
I see you are all hard at work.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.053
Someone high up is visiting from Hanyang.

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:22.723
{\an8}If you do not serve them a meal
with nine side dishes,

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:23.933
it will be an absolute disaster.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.936
So use every last bit of strength you have
to prepare the meal.

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:30.439
This is pure madness.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.525
All I ever made was soybean paste soup,

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:34.318
and now you want a meal
with nine side dishes?

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.362
Wait, mister.

00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:37.863
What?

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:41.742
I'm sorry to ask this,
but why should we prepare that?

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.536
You were not taken for the chaehong.

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:46.330
Then you should send us all home.

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:49.250
You were brought here,

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.335
and you cannot leave without permission.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.170
But we didn't commit any crime.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.922
How dare you talk back to me?

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:56.966
Do you need a good flogging
to come to your senses?

00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:00.970
Miss, you really need to stop.

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:06.684
If we do this well,

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:08.436
will you let us go?

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.063
If you were to prepare a great meal,
then I guess so.

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:12.982
All right then.

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:15.276
How old are the visitors?

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.820
What? You mean their age?

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:20.823
What food do they like? Meat? Seafood?

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:21.782
Are they allergic…

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.827
- I mean, is there anything they can't eat?
- How would I know?

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.413
Stop yapping and get to work. Now!

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.415
Wait.

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:33.335
Cooking food
isn't the same as making an object.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.087
It's not something
you can just throw together.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.799
Are you saying
you want me to find out all those details?

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.384
You said they were important people.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.719
Do you just want me to do as I please?

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.347
Cooking is about
putting your heart into the dish.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.725
My goodness.

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.226
Who are you?

00:12:55.983 --> 00:12:58.027
Well, I'm not from here.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.195
I'm a chef…

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.780
I mean, I'm a cook.

00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:04.116
I can't cook a good meal

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.160
without knowing anything about the guests.

00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:07.828
You are quite the brazen one.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.456
How dare you make up such an excuse?

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:11.624
It's not an excuse.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.628
Everyone here is new to this kitchen,

00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:17.505
and there are almost no ingredients.

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:19.465
What would happen
if we chose to cook the wrong dish?

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:21.759
You don't want that, do you?

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:29.350
What you said…

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.186
is correct.

00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:34.939
- My word.
- Oh, save me.

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:36.649
What do you suggest we do?

00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:38.901
I need to know basic details
like the guests' tastes,

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.694
their age, and their occupation.

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:41.820
And once you know that,

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.239
will you be able to complete a dish

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.783
that will satisfy them
within the given time?

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:48.702
It'll be the guests who decide
whether they like the food or not,

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:50.079
but I'm confident.

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:52.540
Even though
the ingredients are insufficient?

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:55.668
Even so, there's still a shot
if the food is to the guests' taste

00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:58.003
and it's made with care.

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:00.548
Using the best ingredients

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:03.926
doesn't always mean
you make the best dish.

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:07.388
Oh my, miss.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.350
Very well.

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:15.020
However, you must take responsibility
for what you said.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:18.023
One wrong move,
and you could lose your life.

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.401
My life?

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:24.196
Then I have a condition too.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.614
A condition?

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.909
If the guests are satisfied with my food,

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:30.411
I want you

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:33.247
to release us all tonight.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:34.915
Very well.

00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:37.001
Follow me.

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:43.465
Listen carefully.

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.050
Today's guests

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:48.178
are the father and son from the powerful
and influential Im family.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.848
The father is Im Seo-hong,
the Second Minister of Works,

00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:52.850
a seasoned official
who has held various key positions

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:54.560
since the late king's reign.

00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:56.520
His son,
Chief Royal Secretary Im Song-jae,

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.565
{\an8}is an uibin married to Princess Hwisuk,
the king's half-sister.

00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:02.109
{\an8}UIBIN: HUSBAND OF A PRINCESS

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:03.235
Block this!

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.778
{\an8}Im Song-jae was the Crown Prince's cohort,

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:08.157
{\an8}and he and the king are close friends
who grew up together.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.241
Stop right there, Song-jae!

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.492
Come forth!

00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:12.912
Out of the way, fool.

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.914
They ruined countless families

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:17.166
by using the chaehong as an excuse.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.421
Be gentle!

00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:25.090
They are especially picky
about the jeopbingaek,

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:27.092
which is the hospitality meal.

00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:30.220
You may serve the best food you can,

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.431
and yet they always find fault with it.

00:15:32.514 --> 00:15:33.599
What is this?

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.145
Once you get on their wrong side,

00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:40.022
you must offer a great bribe.

00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:42.316
If you cannot afford that,

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:44.443
you are likely to be tortured.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.406
Does that answer your questions?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.785
What? They nitpick about the food
served to them?

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:54.912
They're the absolute worst, aren't they?

00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:58.749
I should teach them

00:15:59.249 --> 00:16:01.835
that they shouldn't mess around with food.

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:03.629
You need to prepare a table for four.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.172
Get to it.

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:06.173
Okay.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.051
Don't forget our promise.

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:28.112
Okay. Gather round, everyone.

00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:30.072
- What?
- What now?

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:32.449
Thanks for speaking up for us.

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:34.702
- That was something.
- You were great.

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:37.496
Not at all. We all have to get out alive.

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:41.875
We're cooking for very picky guests,

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.419
and we need to make four portions.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:47.172
We don't have much time,
so we must decide what to do first.

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.174
Will you all follow my lead?

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:52.469
Of course. It is all or nothing.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.763
Do not even worry.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.974
While waiting for you to get back,

00:16:57.057 --> 00:16:59.393
we gathered
all the ingredients we could find.

00:16:59.476 --> 00:17:01.145
Did you? Where are they?

00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:03.647
- Right here.
- They are all here.

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.024
This is great.

00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:20.289
Everyone has different tastes.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.499
But the guests today are noblemen,

00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.334
and influential ones at that.

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:27.129
They won't be satisfied
with just any dish.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:30.299
There's nothing.

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:33.886
There's nothing to serve as a main dish.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.477
It's meat.

00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:46.315
- Gosh.
- That is big.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.903
It's fresh.

00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:54.490
I found it hidden away in a pot.

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.326
You certainly do have the nose of a dog.
Good job.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.495
Well done.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:02.081
All right. I'll use this to take my shot.

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.958
A French-style steak.

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:06.376
The dish we're going to make…

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.129
is a steak!

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:10.506
"Stack"?

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.550
- "Stack"? What is that?
- "Stack."

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:17.137
Can you not tell? It is a meat dish.

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:19.056
Let us hurry up and get moving!

00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:20.265
Just do as she says.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.059
- Bring that here.
- All right.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:23.936
- This way.
- Go over there.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:26.063
My lord, will this be all right?

00:18:26.688 --> 00:18:28.690
She did not seem to be lying.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.026
I could tell
how sincere she was about food.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.196
I am still not too sure about this.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.823
It does not matter.

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.783
If anything goes wrong,

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.119
they will pay the price.

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.162
Oh, that is right.

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:44.414
What happened to Mi-hyang?

00:18:44.998 --> 00:18:46.208
Oh, right.

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:50.963
She left the village with her nanny
moments ago.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:55.342
It would have been nice
if you could have said goodbye.

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:58.178
She is dead to me now.

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.140
Yes, my lord.

00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:09.815
It has a strong aroma.

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:10.899
Of course.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:14.319
It is from Mount Nogo in our village.

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:15.237
I like it.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:21.410
No, wait. You have to roast them first
to get rid of the fishy smell.

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:24.830
These anchovies are from Deokjeok Island
on the west coast, and--

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:25.998
No.

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:28.167
You need to roast them
to get rid of the fishy smell.

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.335
Make a loop,

00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:34.590
- put it through, and tighten it.
- Like this.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:35.549
There.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:37.009
Will this do?

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:42.181
Rich, right?

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.558
These are fermented shrimp from Mapo Port.

00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:45.893
They taste great.

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:48.353
Please stir-fry them
until they turn into powder.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.870
It's way too tough.

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:08.999
{\an8}It has too much silver skin
and almost no marbled fat, so it's tough.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:19.676
Oh my, what kind of meat is this
that not even a knife can cut through?

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.888
This thing is as tough as rope.

00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:26.183
Is it because it was a bull
that was used for farming?

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:28.352
What should I do?

00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:31.772
No. Think, Yeon Ji-young.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:38.320
Yeah. That's it.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.657
Sangajapbang,
the old cookbook my father showed me.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.911
To cook beef that's too tough to even cut,

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:48.580
I can use the jeonchisu method.

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:53.001
RARE

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:53.919
COOK AT 55°C FOR 30 MINS

00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:55.003
That's it!

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:56.838
There's a corresponding
French cooking method.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:59.967
{\an8}The sous vide method
used to tenderize meat.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:01.885
Low-temperature cooking.

00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:08.016
Okay, there's oil.

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.435
- Gil-geum, get me some hanji.
- Yes?

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.271
As in paper?
Why do you need expensive hanji--

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:13.480
It's urgent. Hurry.

00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:16.441
- You have to get it.
- I will be quick.

00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:20.028
Okay.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:20.946
{\an8}JAHONGWON

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:23.115
{\an8}Is there still no news from His Majesty?

00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:24.533
No, Your Grace.

00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:29.037
The Urimwi accompanied him,
so I am sure he is safe.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.789
{\an8}If you hear any urgent news,
inform me first.

00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:32.165
{\an8}KANG MOK-JU
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT, YI HEON'S CONCUBINE

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:35.794
{\an8}Yes, Your Grace. Do not worry too much.

00:21:35.877 --> 00:21:38.839
Did the Im father and son
head to the Gyeonggi Governor's Office?

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:41.216
They should have arrived by now.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.426
I am rather curious

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:46.805
to see how the expression on the proud
Hong Gyeong-dal's face will change

00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:50.392
when he sees his granddaughter
get taken away for the chaehong.

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:57.858
{\an8}Come forth!

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:01.862
I, Hong Eon-uk, extend my greetings

00:22:01.945 --> 00:22:04.114
to the Second Minister of Works
and Chief Royal Secretary.

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:08.785
Very well. Is your father in good health?

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:12.456
He is well, thanks to your concern.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:13.957
Please follow me.

00:23:15.977 --> 00:23:17.771
But miss,

00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:21.858
why did you wrap the meat in kelp?

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:23.443
The meat is too tough,

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.612
and maturing it with kelp makes it tender.

00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:27.364
How fascinating.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.789
Gil-geum, we have to add
cold water to this.

00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:37.791
But we went through
all that trouble to boil it,

00:23:37.874 --> 00:23:39.167
and now you want to add cold…

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.128
Okay.

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:46.091
I will pour it in now.

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:57.811
But miss,

00:23:57.894 --> 00:24:02.482
can you not grill the meat over a fire
or boil it in water?

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:03.733
- Yes.
- Right.

00:24:04.317 --> 00:24:08.155
This is the only way
to tenderize tough meat.

00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:17.038
- Oh my, miss! What are you doing?
- Oh my goodness.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:18.790
It is still hot!

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:20.750
Are you checking how hot it is?

00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:25.130
The best temperature to make tender meat
is between 49 and 55°C.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:26.840
But…

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:29.217
One more scoop.

00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:37.642
Stop. That's enough.

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:48.528
If heated for a long time
in lukewarm water,

00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:51.448
a protein in the meat
called myosin reacts,

00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:53.450
making the meat tender.

00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:55.785
This is the sous vide method.

00:24:57.746 --> 00:24:59.414
- One more scoop.
- Okay.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.501
The temperature of boiling water
is 100 degrees,

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.962
and room-temperature water
is around 20 degrees.

00:25:06.046 --> 00:25:07.422
If you mix the two waters,

00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:09.216
the temperature levels out
at around 55 degrees,

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:11.551
making sous vide cooking possible.

00:25:13.094 --> 00:25:16.598
Miss, are you sure your hand--

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:20.185
I don't have a thermometer,

00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:22.020
so I have to trust the senses
in my fingertips.

00:25:22.103 --> 00:25:25.148
But your hand has turned red.

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:26.691
Don't worry.

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:29.945
I've done sous vide cooking
countless times before.

00:25:33.114 --> 00:25:36.534
Let me see.

00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:42.374
Let me take a good look at your face.

00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:44.626
You are too shy.

00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:45.919
Are you angry?

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.337
Very well.

00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:49.172
Why…

00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:50.173
Hey!

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.385
That is big. Your mole is too big.

00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:55.720
Your eyes are too big.

00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:56.972
Your mouth is too big.

00:25:58.723 --> 00:25:59.557
You are too tall.

00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:02.060
Were you in such a hurry
that you left your neck at home?

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:04.145
Oh goodness!

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.897
Escort this old lady out!

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:11.403
How will we ever face His Majesty?

00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:13.280
I agree, Father.

00:26:13.363 --> 00:26:16.908
Everyone talks about
the village's great beauty,

00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:20.495
and I expected you to bring her
out of loyalty to your king.

00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:28.628
I have no idea who you speak of.

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:32.090
Who was it again?

00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:33.466
Was it…

00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:35.802
Governor Hong's

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:37.929
granddaughter?

00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:41.683
My lord.

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.978
What are you saying?

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.063
Mi-hyang is but a young girl.

00:26:47.897 --> 00:26:49.357
As you are aware,

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:52.068
this is a chaehong for His Majesty.

00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.631
- Oh my.
- My word.

00:27:14.382 --> 00:27:16.885
- It looks delicious.
- Goodness.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.055
My goodness.

00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:24.309
Thank goodness it worked.

00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:28.813
It smells amazing!

00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:30.523
Can I have a look too?

00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:32.859
It does not look cooked.

00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:34.194
I should taste it.

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.657
It is delicious!

00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:42.535
That is amazing!

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:44.954
What is this, miss?

00:27:45.663 --> 00:27:49.334
This is called
the sous vide cooking method.

00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:55.048
I see, cooking meat in water like that
is called "sous vido."

00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:57.425
It's not done yet. We have to sear it now.

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:58.426
- "Cheer"?
- What?

00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:00.095
Please get me some rice straw.

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:03.515
- I guess she needs it for cheering.
- Let us get it then.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.308
So,

00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:07.477
how old are you now?

00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:11.523
My lord. The feast is ready.

00:28:12.774 --> 00:28:14.401
{\an8}The seokban is ready.

00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:16.778
{\an8}They say public duty
comes before private matters,

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.655
{\an8}so how about we dine first?

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.534
Dinner, you say?

00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:27.622
Let us do that.

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.959
Welcome.

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:34.212
The trip must have been long and arduous.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.257
So,

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.843
is His Majesty well?

00:28:39.926 --> 00:28:43.346
Do you ask because you do not know,
Governor Hong?

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.681
Your letters of appeal

00:28:44.764 --> 00:28:48.810
requesting that His Majesty
depose Fourth Junior Consort Kang

00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:52.021
caused quite an uproar in the palace.

00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:54.232
Oh, come on, Father.

00:28:54.315 --> 00:28:57.318
Why would you bring that up here?

00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:58.695
You are embarrassing him.

00:28:58.778 --> 00:29:01.406
It is fine. You can speak freely.

00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:06.119
Well, it is a fact
that the letters displeased His Majesty.

00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:07.537
Is that why

00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:10.915
he sent his chaehong inspectors
all the way here?

00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:12.792
You are mistaken.

00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:15.628
That is a separate matter.

00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:19.966
Goodness, I am famished after a long trip,

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:23.803
and all you serve us are tea and snacks?

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.473
I apologize, my lord.

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:28.183
We will get the meal--

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:31.352
How direct you both are.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.938
Come on now. Serve the food.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:35.732
Yes, my lord.

00:29:35.815 --> 00:29:38.151
We will serve the prepared feast.

00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:56.544
My goodness.

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:59.297
Well, this is just…

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.842
It seems this region
was the only one to suffer a famine.

00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:10.433
I am afraid we cannot accept this dinner.

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:12.519
The jeopbingaek
a governor serves to his guests

00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:15.230
should reflect the region's
landscapes and customs,

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.190
such that one can discern the geography,
the people's sentiment,

00:30:17.273 --> 00:30:19.901
and even the success of the harvest
from the meal alone.

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:24.864
However, all I see on this table
are a few pieces of meat.

00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:28.535
This is not at all different
from a barbarian's fare.

00:30:28.618 --> 00:30:30.954
What a disappointment.

00:30:31.037 --> 00:30:35.750
{\an8}You do not deserve the title of a governor
who is expected to watch over the people.

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.002
{\an8}It seems you do not think much of us

00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:41.381
when we are here
carrying out a royal command.

00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.801
How do you explain this?

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:49.681
The truth is, we had a problem
with the kitchen maids last night.

00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:52.392
It seems that this was a mistake
made by the newly appointed cook.

00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:54.143
I ask that you forgive the discourtesy.

00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:57.605
I was unaware of what went on
in my own household

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:59.440
and committed such a grave discourtesy.

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:01.025
I sincerely apologize.

00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:02.694
This will not do!

00:31:02.777 --> 00:31:06.072
How could you insult us so blatantly?

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:10.702
In that case,

00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:13.830
will you offer something else?

00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:17.417
Something else? What exactly do you mean?

00:31:18.918 --> 00:31:22.130
Whatever it may be,
it would not make a difference.

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:24.382
I will call forth the cook
who prepared this

00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:26.718
and punish them myself.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.469
So please do not be so angry.

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:32.682
Official Hong, what do you mean?

00:31:32.765 --> 00:31:36.561
Bring all the cooks from the kitchen!

00:31:36.644 --> 00:31:38.271
Yes, my lord.

00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:51.409
Let's think of what to do when I get out.

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:54.120
I don't know how I got here,

00:31:55.538 --> 00:31:57.624
but I can't waste my time doing nothing.

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:03.755
What are you doing, Gil-geum?

00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:09.510
Whenever you find free food,
you must take whatever you can.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.763
There.

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.724
- Drag them all out!
- Yes, sir!

00:32:14.807 --> 00:32:17.477
- Oh no!
- Not again!

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.811
What now?

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.689
What is going on?

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.650
- No!
- Let go of me!

00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:25.985
What is this about? Miss! Oh my!

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:32.158
- Oh my gosh.
- Spare us, please!

00:32:32.241 --> 00:32:34.452
Food served to a noble

00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:37.914
should be made with all the
natural ingredients from the region!

00:32:37.997 --> 00:32:41.250
However, the food on these tables
is nothing but a few slices of meat!

00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:43.503
- How is this a proper jeopbingaek?
- What the heck is going on?

00:32:43.586 --> 00:32:46.297
I will punish you severely for your crime.

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:49.717
Please forgive us!

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.678
They didn't even eat it yet.

00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:53.721
Are they trying to nitpick?

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:58.101
I'm sorry, but did you even try the food
before criticizing it?

00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:01.145
If you didn't, this is quite unfair.

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:04.607
The meal on those tables
holds the essence of nature itself.

00:33:04.691 --> 00:33:06.401
You are a bold wench.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.238
Did you say this meal
holds the nature of this region?

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.782
Yes, I did.

00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:14.450
Tell me how that is.

00:33:14.534 --> 00:33:17.662
If you speak nonsense,
you will have to pay the price.

00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:22.000
It won't taste good if it gets cold,
so let's get them to eat it first.

00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:25.378
My lord.

00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:28.506
You must taste food to appreciate it.

00:33:28.589 --> 00:33:31.092
I'll explain after you try it.

00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:34.345
How dare you, you insolent thing!

00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:36.889
My goodness.

00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:41.436
You have prepared
quite an amusing show, Governor.

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:45.523
Perhaps I shall show you
what I have prepared.

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.734
Bring her in!

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:48.860
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.821
My lady!

00:33:51.904 --> 00:33:53.698
Oh dear. My lady!

00:33:54.991 --> 00:33:56.242
Mi-hyang!

00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:57.702
- Father…
- My lady.

00:33:58.786 --> 00:34:00.038
Mi-hyang.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.290
Mi-hyang.

00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:04.667
Mi-hyang…

00:34:06.753 --> 00:34:08.254
How dare you!

00:34:08.838 --> 00:34:10.298
What do you think, Governor Hong?

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.842
Is my surprise to your liking?

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.305
If what she said is true,

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:20.767
we will consider this a proper jeopbingaek
and leave in peace.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.809
If not…

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:26.481
I will take your granddaughter with me.

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:30.818
HONG

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.070
{\an8}This is a chaehong plaque.

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:34.614
It is a royal command.

00:34:35.198 --> 00:34:37.950
So that punk
is the chaehong inspector, huh?

00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:40.328
Im Song-jae, the most treacherous subject.

00:34:42.497 --> 00:34:45.333
You are unbelievably impertinent.

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:49.170
You may be the Chief Royal Secretary
favored by His Majesty,

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:51.297
but you cannot threaten me

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.550
or demand to take my granddaughter
for the chaehong!

00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:58.805
You are a human being,
and you should be ashamed!

00:34:58.888 --> 00:35:01.015
Please calm down, Governor,

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:04.268
or your family line may end here.

00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:07.814
You are the much respected
and honored Governor Hong Gyeong-dal,

00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:12.235
and you should know better
than to lash out like this.

00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:14.153
Hong Gyeong-dal?

00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:16.239
I will pretend I did not hear that.

00:35:16.322 --> 00:35:18.074
As I said before,

00:35:18.658 --> 00:35:21.285
if the food that wench made moves me,

00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:23.871
then I will pretend
that none of this happened.

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:26.040
So please calm yourself, Governor.

00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:37.093
Now, please taste the food.

00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:39.637
Oh, before we do that,

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.892
I must put the wench who made this
in her place.

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.144
No way.

00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:48.312
All I did was cook!

00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:49.772
Tell me.

00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:52.567
If this meal
does not hold the essence of nature,

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.693
what then?

00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:56.904
Will you give up your life?

00:35:57.488 --> 00:36:00.366
I don't know how to go back anyway,
so what do I have to lose?

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.578
The sous vide was perfectly done.

00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:06.747
Yes, I will.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.332
So try the food.

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:09.709
Very well.

00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:11.794
Miss!

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.662
What is this?

00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:54.670
This texture.

00:36:54.754 --> 00:36:55.922
This taste.

00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:58.299
It is a flavor I have never tasted before.

00:36:59.592 --> 00:37:02.511
I can barely chew the meat.

00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:04.013
It melts away.

00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:06.015
The juices fill my mouth.

00:37:07.183 --> 00:37:08.226
And this sauce.

00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:09.810
What in the world is this?

00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:20.029
{\an8}Guanylic acid in Pyogo mushrooms,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.282
{\an8}inosinic acid in anchovies,

00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:26.077
and glutamic acid in fermented shrimp.

00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:47.139
When amino acids from different groups
are combined in specific ratios,

00:37:47.223 --> 00:37:49.225
you get a major boost of umami flavor.

00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:52.353
The so-called umami bomb that we call

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:53.938
MSG.

00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:57.316
It's no different from the modern-day
synthetic seasoning we use.

00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:13.624
This is just

00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:16.252
a plate of common boiled beef.

00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:36.605
What now?

00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:39.942
I could not feel
the nature you spoke of in this dish.

00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:45.156
They say it's impossible
to stop a human from lying.

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.699
Do you have anything to say?

00:38:48.117 --> 00:38:49.535
It may look like

00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:52.038
I served you nothing but meat,

00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:55.958
but I actually used ingredients
from all over this region.

00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:59.045
- Is that so?
- The salt you dipped the meat in.

00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:01.714
That contains fermented shrimp
from Mapo Port,

00:39:01.797 --> 00:39:03.299
anchovies from the west coast,

00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:05.968
and Pyogo mushrooms from Mount Nogo.

00:39:06.052 --> 00:39:08.596
If that doesn't contain nature,

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:11.057
then what food possibly could?

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.516
That is quite strange.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.935
Your words evoke a sense of nature,

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:17.480
but I did not feel or taste it
in your food.

00:39:17.563 --> 00:39:19.899
You are lying!

00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:22.860
What do you mean, Governor?

00:39:22.943 --> 00:39:26.530
I have never tasted
anything like this in my life.

00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:31.535
However, you are lying just so you can
take away my granddaughter!

00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:35.581
Your treachery will anger
the people and the heavens!

00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:41.796
I knew it.

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:44.382
He was never going to tell the truth
because of the chaehong.

00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:46.008
A treacherous subject like you

00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:48.177
will die by my hand!

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.428
Father!

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:51.972
Father!

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:54.892
This is all due to my incompetence.

00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:56.560
Please calm down.

00:39:57.144 --> 00:39:58.270
Let go of me.

00:39:58.354 --> 00:39:59.647
Father!

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:01.899
You must not do this.

00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:06.695
My gosh.

00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:09.240
This is truly a sight
that brings forth tears.

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:11.700
"Father."

00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:23.462
Do not just stand there.

00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:26.507
Strike that criminal at once!

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.552
- I am sorry. Forgive us.
- What? Me?

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.097
Am I really going to die
an unjust death here?

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.598
In Joseon?

00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:38.352
God, Buddha, someone! Help me, please.

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.729
No!

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.566
No, please! Wait!

00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:45.067
Blame your cooking.

00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:47.319
Nothing was wrong with my cooking!

00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:49.280
It's your tongue that's lying!

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:52.408
What are you doing? No, stop it.

00:40:54.994 --> 00:40:58.414
No! Save me! Let me go, please!

00:40:58.497 --> 00:40:59.540
Father.

00:41:06.922 --> 00:41:08.215
No!

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:12.303
Spare me, please.

00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:13.471
Halt!

00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:33.532
His Majesty the King has arrived!

00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.497
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.250
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.020
If what you say is true…

00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:05.189
Wait. This voice…

00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:08.108
I will try it myself.

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:09.527
No way.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.612
It can't be that fool.

00:42:20.162 --> 00:42:21.372
No way!

00:42:21.455 --> 00:42:23.332
"Your Majesty"?

00:42:30.464 --> 00:42:32.424
{\an8}Rise, gwinyeo.

00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:34.385
{\an8}I'm screwed.

00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:36.762
{\an8}He really was Yeonhuigun.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.014
Who are you?

00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:41.016
Who in the world are you?

00:42:41.976 --> 00:42:42.851
Are you crazy?

00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:44.728
You crazy fool!

00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:46.230
Hey. Do you not
get the situation right now?

00:42:46.313 --> 00:42:47.565
I command you as the King of Joseon!

00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:49.149
I am the king of this country.

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:52.361
I am the king of this country.

00:42:54.697 --> 00:42:57.533
Why are you still on the ground?

00:42:57.616 --> 00:42:58.659
Dad.

00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:01.870
I'm sorry for leaving you behind.

00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:06.166
I wish…

00:43:09.336 --> 00:43:10.421
You will wish

00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:14.300
you were beaten to death
with a wooden plank instead.

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:43.912
What a simple and humble spread.

00:43:43.996 --> 00:43:45.623
Come and taste it first.

00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:47.374
What? Me?

00:43:49.084 --> 00:43:50.252
Yes, you.

00:43:55.424 --> 00:43:56.383
Sure.

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:26.163
Right.

00:44:26.246 --> 00:44:29.041
You're a famous gourmet
in the Joseon Dynasty

00:44:29.124 --> 00:44:30.459
who has an absolute sense of taste.

00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:33.003
Then surely he'll judge fairly, right?

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:37.383
Do not get your hopes up.

00:44:37.466 --> 00:44:39.718
If it is not better than the bibinbap…

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.327
How can the meat be so tender?

00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:11.834
The more I chew,

00:45:11.917 --> 00:45:13.961
the more the juices flow and linger.

00:45:15.129 --> 00:45:16.422
The light and clean taste

00:45:17.631 --> 00:45:19.842
reaches a peak, then melts away.

00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:22.386
Wait.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.388
This seasoning…

00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:41.029
I truly cannot

00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:43.365
believe this taste.

00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:45.868
This is the very essence of savory flavor.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.124
What on earth did you make it with?

00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:55.919
His taste buds sure are different.

00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:58.755
To perceive MSG like that, truly amazing.

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:00.215
He's a gourmet, all right.

00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:04.511
Simply put,

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:07.806
it's an item I use
to enrich the flavor of food.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:11.310
It enhances savoriness
and reduces saltiness.

00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:12.978
"Item," you say?

00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:16.273
I see.

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:17.733
So that was it.

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:43.675
The pickled omija

00:46:43.759 --> 00:46:45.969
and grilled green onions on the side
are incredibly appetizing,

00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.055
and they pair perfectly with the meat.

00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:50.641
This dish is truly…

00:46:52.226 --> 00:46:53.560
the greatest taste on the land.

00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:55.771
I'm going to live.

00:46:55.854 --> 00:46:57.606
I'm going to live!

00:46:59.024 --> 00:47:01.527
It tasted rather nostalgic,

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.028
and for the first time in a long while,

00:47:03.779 --> 00:47:05.781
I was satisfied with the meal.

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:12.663
So why did you
criticize the food so dreadfully?

00:47:14.414 --> 00:47:18.418
The meal befits you, Your Majesty,
who rules a nation.

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:19.878
It is only natural

00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:22.798
that my insignificant tongue
could not appreciate the flavors.

00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:25.717
You're called treacherous for a reason.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.887
I thought you said
you couldn't taste anything earlier.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:33.433
You surprised me twice today.

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:38.939
I'm a chef!

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.816
I'm Chef Yeon Ji-young!

00:47:40.899 --> 00:47:43.318
A cook! I'm a cook!

00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:45.445
Now that I think about it,

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:48.657
you said you were a cook from Chef,
is that right?

00:47:49.408 --> 00:47:51.451
I'm a chef. It's the same thing as a cook.

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:55.122
Judging by your skills,
you were not lying.

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:57.624
{\an8}- You really are a skilled cook.
- Yes.

00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:02.588
Being a cook is traditionally
a man's occupation.

00:48:02.671 --> 00:48:05.507
So how did you, a woman, become one?

00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:06.633
What's going on?

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:09.136
Is this an interview?

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.807
My dad loves to cook,

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:17.436
so tasting food and making it

00:48:17.519 --> 00:48:18.854
became a calling.

00:48:19.438 --> 00:48:20.772
A calling, you say?

00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:24.693
Did you ever regret becoming a cook?

00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:29.406
Well, you see,
a calling comes with tribulations.

00:48:32.117 --> 00:48:35.370
It's just like how being a king
comes with perks,

00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:37.998
but also challenges and hardships.

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.085
I see.

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:44.504
Anyway,

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:45.756
I feel most rewarded as a cook

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:48.508
when people with exceptional palates
like you, Your Majesty,

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:51.678
acknowledge my cooking.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.352
What is your name?

00:48:59.227 --> 00:49:00.270
It's Yeon Ji-young.

00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:02.439
The Yeon family, I see. And your age?

00:49:02.522 --> 00:49:03.482
I'm 27.

00:49:03.565 --> 00:49:04.399
What?

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:06.443
You are 27 years old?

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:09.571
You are older than you look.

00:49:09.655 --> 00:49:11.239
Do you have a jiabi?

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.533
Jiabi…

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.118
Oh, a husband.

00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:16.995
I haven't married yet.

00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:20.040
Oh dear. You are unwed at that age?

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:21.625
What a pity.

00:49:22.542 --> 00:49:24.753
Oh, no, don't get me wrong.

00:49:24.836 --> 00:49:26.296
I'm not from around here,

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.341
so it's not like what you think,
Your Majesty.

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.970
Then where are you from?

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:36.723
Should I tell the truth?

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:37.808
Or not?

00:49:40.435 --> 00:49:42.229
I don't think he'll believe me.

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.648
I know this may be hard to believe,

00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:46.942
but I'm from…

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:54.866
500 years in the future.

00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:03.041
I see.

00:50:03.125 --> 00:50:05.293
Does he really believe me?

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.256
I will not take your life today.

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:11.633
Do you believe me?

00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:14.469
It is a shame
you are not right in your mind,

00:50:14.553 --> 00:50:17.723
but your talent saved you today.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.018
So he thinks I'm crazy, huh?

00:50:22.102 --> 00:50:24.813
Yeah. Well, I don't believe it myself.

00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:28.066
I know it's hard to believe,

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:30.026
but I'm…

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.280
I'm from another era that we call Korea.

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:35.991
What is this impertinence
in front of His Majesty? That is enough!

00:50:37.784 --> 00:50:38.702
Okay.

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:41.955
Of course you don't believe me.

00:50:42.998 --> 00:50:44.833
I'm not crazy.

00:50:44.916 --> 00:50:47.419
This is the truth, and I can't help it.

00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:54.342
That is enough. Come to the side.

00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:06.354
Think what you will.

00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:08.106
Just let me go.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.066
You said it was
the greatest taste on the land.

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.281
You're going to let me go, right?

00:51:19.785 --> 00:51:22.329
Is he letting me go or not?

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:23.914
This is driving me crazy.

00:51:24.456 --> 00:51:25.290
Chief Royal Secretary.

00:51:25.957 --> 00:51:26.958
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:29.044
You're letting me go, right?

00:51:29.127 --> 00:51:30.337
Please.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.422
Please…

00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:34.299
That cook…

00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:38.678
is to be locked up
and taken to the palace with me tomorrow.

00:51:39.888 --> 00:51:41.097
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:43.225
You've got to be kidding me.

00:51:43.308 --> 00:51:45.393
So he's not letting me go.

00:51:45.477 --> 00:51:49.272
What shall we do
about Governor Hong's granddaughter?

00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:55.779
Right, I will also take her
to the palace with me, so prepare her.

00:51:57.364 --> 00:51:58.698
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:00.659
Understood.

00:52:04.162 --> 00:52:05.705
He's taking that young girl?

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:07.999
Jeez, that's just not right.

00:52:10.252 --> 00:52:13.255
Wait. Hong Gyeong-dal's granddaughter?

00:52:13.338 --> 00:52:15.632
Isn't this what sparks

00:52:15.715 --> 00:52:18.009
{\an8}the Gapshin Literati Purge?

00:52:18.093 --> 00:52:19.636
{\an8}RETALIATION WHERE YEONHUIGUN EXECUTED
OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN HIS MOTHER'S DEATH

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.222
You may all leave.

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:24.140
I am tired.

00:52:24.224 --> 00:52:26.309
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:39.781
Hurry and leave.

00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:41.741
I said leave!

00:52:46.413 --> 00:52:47.414
Hurry.

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:49.958
They say you reap what you sow.

00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:51.793
Old adages are never wrong.

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.629
{\an8}Judging by the things he does,
it's no wonder a literati purge occurred.

00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:56.631
{\an8}He's just the absolute worst.

00:52:57.132 --> 00:52:58.133
{\an8}You wench!

00:52:59.217 --> 00:53:00.051
Follow me.

00:53:09.644 --> 00:53:12.355
Why are you still here?

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:17.527
Are you not ashamed before the late king?

00:53:21.823 --> 00:53:22.991
Sheathe your sword.

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:27.621
You neglect state affairs
while wrapped up in a woman's embrace,

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:30.373
do not value the lives of court officials,

00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:32.626
and look down on the lives of your people!

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:34.878
Do you truly not see
that those are the very reasons

00:53:34.961 --> 00:53:40.592
why your officials do not respect you
and your subjects no longer serve you?

00:53:41.676 --> 00:53:43.219
Say that again.

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:46.556
Your Majesty.

00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:51.728
Please regain your senses and wisdom.

00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:55.857
You must punish the treacherous subjects

00:53:55.941 --> 00:53:59.694
and women who thrive on your power.

00:53:59.778 --> 00:54:02.572
Only then will this nation stand strong!

00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:12.832
Say that again.

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.000
Your Majesty.

00:54:15.543 --> 00:54:17.545
Your Majesty.

00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:20.173
Now that your granddaughter's life
hangs in the balance,

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.509
are you worried
about the affairs of the state?

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:26.596
What do you know about how I feel?

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.014
Your Majesty.

00:54:29.057 --> 00:54:34.104
Please just take my life instead!

00:54:35.814 --> 00:54:39.985
Do you now feel the pain of knowing
there is nothing you can do

00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:42.570
to save your family?

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:46.116
Your Majesty.

00:54:47.158 --> 00:54:51.121
You must live
and suffer in agony for years.

00:54:51.204 --> 00:54:55.000
That is the punishment I give you

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:58.670
for driving my mother to her death.

00:55:01.506 --> 00:55:02.674
Guards!

00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:04.175
{\an8}Drag out the criminal

00:55:04.259 --> 00:55:06.803
{\an8}who has committed blasphemy
against his king!

00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:10.098
{\an8}Your Majesty.

00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:11.891
Your Majesty.

00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:14.436
Exile him to the furthest end

00:55:14.519 --> 00:55:17.522
of North Hamgyong Province
tomorrow morning.

00:55:17.605 --> 00:55:18.815
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:55:18.898 --> 00:55:21.359
Your Majesty.

00:55:21.443 --> 00:55:22.402
Your Majesty!

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:23.820
Your Majesty!

00:55:23.903 --> 00:55:26.031
Your Majesty!

00:55:33.955 --> 00:55:35.832
What is all this?

00:55:36.916 --> 00:55:41.838
Miss, are you sure
His Majesty enjoyed the food?

00:55:41.921 --> 00:55:46.051
I swear I heard him say
it was the greatest taste on the land.

00:55:46.134 --> 00:55:50.722
Then why did they let all the others go
but lock us up?

00:55:50.805 --> 00:55:51.723
How would I know?

00:55:52.932 --> 00:55:56.686
I'd love to look into the fool's head
to see what the hell he's thinking!

00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:57.854
My gosh.

00:55:57.937 --> 00:56:01.483
Anyway, they said
we're going to the palace tomorrow.

00:56:02.317 --> 00:56:03.443
This is bad.

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:05.320
Things are just getting worse.

00:56:05.403 --> 00:56:06.696
What did you say?

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.989
The palace?

00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:10.700
I need to go back before we get there.

00:56:11.409 --> 00:56:13.078
This is driving me crazy.

00:56:13.161 --> 00:56:15.080
Where do you need to go?

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.793
To where I came from. Where else?

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:22.629
Right. And where is that?

00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:25.465
Gil-geum.

00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:27.926
I know you won't believe me,

00:56:28.009 --> 00:56:31.971
but I came from far off in the future.

00:56:33.807 --> 00:56:36.017
Man, what am I even doing?

00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:37.352
Forget it.

00:56:37.435 --> 00:56:42.232
No, miss. I believe you.

00:56:42.315 --> 00:56:45.276
When I first saw you,

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.737
I smelled something
I had never smelled before.

00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:50.365
And you cooked things I had never seen.

00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:51.991
So I believe you.

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:54.327
- Do you really, Gil-geum?
- Yes.

00:56:56.121 --> 00:57:00.208
Actually, I was in Paris,
and I was on a plane back to Korea.

00:57:00.291 --> 00:57:01.251
On a flame?

00:57:01.334 --> 00:57:05.380
Just listen to me.
I took a plane from France to Korea,

00:57:05.463 --> 00:57:06.422
and someone spilled coffee on me,

00:57:06.506 --> 00:57:08.967
so I went to the bathroom
and opened a book…

00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:11.886
Right. Mangunrok.

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.683
I read the first page,
and like a magic book…

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:19.144
Where did that book go?

00:57:20.228 --> 00:57:21.729
Right, my handbag!

00:57:27.193 --> 00:57:28.486
My handbag.

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.196
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.366
I just realized something important.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:35.160
What is that?

00:57:35.243 --> 00:57:38.496
There's an important book
called Mangunrok.

00:57:39.164 --> 00:57:40.790
And I lost it.

00:57:40.874 --> 00:57:43.042
Mangunrok?

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:45.378
I have to find the handbag the book is in.

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:46.588
That's the only way I can go back.

00:57:46.671 --> 00:57:51.009
Remember the cliff I asked you
to take me to when I was at your house?

00:57:51.092 --> 00:57:51.926
Yes.

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:53.344
I lost it there.

00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:55.388
What am I going to do?

00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:58.933
How are we going to get out of here?

00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:13.448
Oh goodness!

00:58:14.199 --> 00:58:15.074
I apologize, Your Majesty.

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:17.911
Why are you sneaking up on me like that?

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.329
It is cold out here.

00:58:20.121 --> 00:58:21.414
You should go inside.

00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:22.582
Song-jae.

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:24.375
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:58:24.459 --> 00:58:26.544
It is just us here, so speak freely.

00:58:27.212 --> 00:58:29.297
- No, Your Majesty.
- What now?

00:58:30.798 --> 00:58:32.258
You are too slow.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:40.016
I see you are still nimble.

00:59:10.922 --> 00:59:12.090
Look at you.

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:28.565
Song-jae.

00:59:28.648 --> 00:59:29.691
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:59:30.483 --> 00:59:34.112
Other than the cook named Yeon Ji-young
and the girl she was with,

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:39.158
release all the women
you captured here today for the chaehong.

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.118
Pardon?

00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:44.122
Are you not taking
Governor Hong's granddaughter either?

00:59:45.373 --> 00:59:46.291
No.

00:59:47.292 --> 00:59:50.712
She will become a government slave

00:59:50.795 --> 00:59:52.630
once Hong Gyeong-dal
is sent into exile anyway.

00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:53.840
Your Majesty.

00:59:54.799 --> 00:59:56.884
Did the chaehong upset you?

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.138
No.

01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:03.641
You're insane.
That heir nonsense is just an excuse.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:06.060
He was just crazy about women.
What an excuse.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:11.649
The chaehong was just an excuse
to avenge my mother.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.192
You know that.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:17.697
The girl gave me a reason
to exile her grandfather.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:19.824
That is good enough.

01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:22.577
However, Your Majesty,
if you call off the chaehong now,

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:24.662
you will incur the suspicion

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.040
of the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
that you are avenging your mother.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.917
This is too minor an incident
for her to grow suspicious.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.211
And for some reason…

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:37.258
I feel rather drained today.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.971
Then how about…

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.141
I enter the chamber in your stead tonight?

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:51.147
You have gone too far with your joke.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.612
Who are you?

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:05.328
Do not fear. I came to keep my promise.

01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:07.455
You're that guy from earlier…

01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:09.290
I mean, the lord, right?

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:12.293
You successfully finished the jeopbingaek,
so I shall let you go.

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:16.172
Are you sure about that?

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.341
Take this.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.343
And this too.

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.638
If you go that way,

01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:25.473
you will find the back gate of the office.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.183
Hurry and go.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:29.769
- Well, then…
- Okay.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.647
- Let us go.
- Yes, my lord.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:33.940
Excuse me.

01:01:35.983 --> 01:01:38.194
I don't know how this may sound,

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:40.905
but that tyrant will be punished one day.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:42.365
Thank you.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.033
Thank you so much.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:46.744
Let's go.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.013
Your Majesty, it is I,
the Chief Royal Secretary.

01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:09.976
What is it?

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:13.896
The cooks who served you
have escaped from the prison.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:15.898
What?

01:02:17.775 --> 01:02:20.611
By the way, where's your family?

01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:23.740
I am alone.

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:25.658
What?

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:30.747
My father was a military officer
at the Left Jeolla Naval Base,

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:34.459
but he was framed and taken away,
so I do not know if he is dead or alive.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:35.376
As for my mother,

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.921
she and I were on our way to Hanyang
to look for my father,

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.758
but we were attacked by
a group of bandits, and she passed away.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:43.593
I'm sorry for asking.

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:46.846
- I had no idea. I shouldn't have asked.
- Do not worry.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.890
How could you have known?

01:02:48.973 --> 01:02:50.516
It is fine, really.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:53.978
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:57.356
Do you want to come with me?

01:02:58.566 --> 01:02:59.567
Where to?

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:01.444
To 500 years in the future.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:03.821
Let's go back to the time I was living in.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.200
Can I?

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.243
Can I really go with you?

01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:11.496
What's your dream?

01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:13.498
My dream?

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:14.582
What do you want to be?

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:17.418
As long as you work hard,
you can be anything there.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:20.046
If I can be anything,

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:23.758
I want to be the senior court lady
of the royal kitchen.

01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:26.052
Okay.

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:28.513
While I'm here,

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:30.473
I'll teach you how to cook.

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:34.143
Really? You cannot take that back.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:37.814
Were you the senior court lady
of the royal kitchen where you live?

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:41.067
No, I was a three-star Michelin chef.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.368
Miss, this is the only cliff in this area.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:53.079
My gosh. That was a tough climb.

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:56.749
It has been such a long day.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:00.670
It is so dark. I cannot see a thing.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:01.838
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.130
- This is the place.
- It is?

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:04.090
Yeah.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.050
My gosh.

01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:07.343
Miss!

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:12.098
Did I not lose it here?

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.933
- Shine the light over here.
- Here?

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.726
I do not see anything.

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:19.772
- You can't see, can you?
- No. My gosh.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.607
I can't see in the dark.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.776
- It's not this side.
- No?

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:26.028
Then…

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.446
I think it went that way.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.199
- It flew that way.
- Okay.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:33.119
I think it landed somewhere here.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:34.036
Miss.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.747
- Shine the light here.
- Okay.

01:04:37.498 --> 01:04:39.166
Where did it go?

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.710
It is not here either.

01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:42.753
I do not see anything.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.756
Why isn't it here?
I swear it went this way.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.093
Miss, look over there.

01:04:49.176 --> 01:04:50.219
Do you see anything?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.554
Yes.

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:05.860
Your Majesty.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.532
Well, you see…

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.713
No, wait! I'll explain everything!

01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:29.425
Please, let me explain.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:31.761
Please…

01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:46.192
Now explain.

01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:49.153
I'm sorry.

01:05:49.236 --> 01:05:51.989
I came to find the handbag I lost.

01:05:52.573 --> 01:05:54.325
- "Handbag"?
- Yes.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:58.120
The handbag that flew away
when you shot it with the arrow.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.248
Oh, that?

01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:04.919
There's a book
called Mangunrok in the handbag.

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:09.840
I think that's the book
that brought me to the Joseon Dynasty.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.510
"Mangunrok"?

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:17.139
What an excuse.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.228
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's not an excuse.

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:25.022
I really need that book, Your Majesty.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:27.650
Is it important enough

01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:31.696
to commit yet another treason
by escaping prison at night?

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:34.156
Yes. That book is as important as my life.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.111
What a relief.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.531
Is this it?

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:18.409
Yes, this is it! Thank you!

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:23.873
You crazy bastard!

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.210
Now you have no reason to run away.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:30.337
What the hell are you doing?

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:33.340
Look at you.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.384
You are taking
that insolent tone with me again.

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:39.013
Your Majesty.

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:42.433
I'm sorry for being insolent.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.144
I'll do anything you say,

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:47.605
so please get that handbag back for me.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:49.940
You will do…

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.402
anything I say?

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:54.487
Yes.

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:56.655
What?

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.583
Don't you think this is just wrong?

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:12.546
Why is he going so far to torment us?

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.799
If I ever had to go to the palace,

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:17.468
I hoped it would be
as a maid in the royal kitchen.

01:08:18.135 --> 01:08:23.265
What are we going to do
now that we are on His Majesty's bad side?

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:28.562
I'll protect you, no matter what,
so don't worry.

01:08:28.646 --> 01:08:30.689
Brace yourself and be strong, okay?

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.444
Okay. I will also protect you,
no matter what.

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.530
We should both stay strong.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:38.572
- Okay.
- Yes.

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:44.245
I'm going to find that Mangunrok
at all costs and go back,

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.454
no matter what.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:51.210
Your Majesty, what is the reason
you are taking that woman with you?

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.088
Because

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.715
I do not want her to die a peaceful death.

01:09:05.766 --> 01:09:11.063
If only I had a gun,
I'd just shoot him dead at once.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.342
I have received word.

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:45.890
Something dreadful
has happened to His Majesty.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:48.893
Was it an assassin?

01:09:48.976 --> 01:09:52.646
{\an8}Fortunately, he was not harmed.

01:09:53.397 --> 01:09:54.815
Whose doing was it?

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:58.402
Probably one of us.

01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:01.947
Do you mean
someone took action on their own?

01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:09.663
They probably could not wait.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:12.958
I told them time and time again
to wait until the right moment.

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:17.713
If they put us all at risk
before we execute the plan,

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.799
they must be eliminated.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.636
Shall I look into it discreetly?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:26.680
There is no need.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:29.808
I have an idea who it was,
and they are being followed.

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:34.813
You should be extra careful.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.024
Yes, Your Highness.

01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:40.611
Just greet the king as you usually do,

01:10:40.694 --> 01:10:42.655
so that he can forget
the burdens of state affairs

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:45.157
and his anger toward the court officials,

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:49.119
and be driven mad
with curiosity about his mother.

01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:52.957
Captivate him so he loses himself.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:56.460
I understand.

01:11:02.883 --> 01:11:04.551
By the way, Mok-ju.

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:07.054
Yes, Your Highness.

01:11:07.888 --> 01:11:09.598
I hear

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:14.561
that His Majesty is bringing a woman
back from the Gyeonggi Governor's Office.

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:16.480
It must be
Hong Gyeong-dal's granddaughter.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:22.653
I wonder.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.103
You may all leave.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:57.771
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Yes, Your Grace.

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:04.361
Chu-wol, are you there?

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:05.779
Yes, Your Grace.

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.328
How much longer until His Majesty arrives?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:14.997
He just left
the Gyeonggi Governor's Office,

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.417
{\an8}so he will arrive sometime between
the fifteenth and seventeenth hour.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.086
{\an8}He will bring
Hong Gyeong-dal's granddaughter.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.422
I hear she is a great beauty.

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:26.258
No one can compare to you, Your Grace.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:30.596
I will make it clear to her
that I am the only woman for His Majesty.

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:31.805
Just wait and see

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:35.351
how I torment that young thing
until she withers away.

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:38.228
- Get lost, gwinyeo!
- Go away!

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:40.898
- Go away!
- Go away!

01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:43.192
Hey! What are you doing?

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:47.279
What? Do you want to see
what a gwinyeo can do?

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.200
- You little brats!
- You fools!

01:12:51.283 --> 01:12:54.912
- I will remember your faces!
- Those tiny little punks.

01:12:54.995 --> 01:12:57.831
- Are you all right, miss?
- Stop right here!

01:12:58.749 --> 01:12:59.583
Forget it.

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:02.753
You kids must be
at least 500 years older than me.

01:13:02.836 --> 01:13:03.921
Yeah, let's just forget it.

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:11.553
No matter how many times I look around,

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:13.180
this is Joseon for sure.

01:13:13.263 --> 01:13:14.598
I have to control myself.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:21.897
Oh my gosh!

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.358
How dare they harm something
that belongs to me?

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:27.152
They should be taught a lesson.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.612
Your Majesty.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.448
That "something" you just mentioned.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:33.617
Are you referring to me?

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.993
That is right.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.538
From now on, you cannot see anyone,

01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:40.749
go anywhere, or speak with anyone
without my permission.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:44.086
So there's nothing I can do.

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:46.547
From being a rebel to a gwinyeo,

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:48.340
now I'm someone's possession.

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:51.009
I'm at a loss for words.

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.261
Yes.

01:13:52.344 --> 01:13:54.763
They say act mute for three years,
deaf for three years,

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:56.181
and blind for another three.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.352
Think of it as a basic rule
to survive in the palace.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.980
I will prepare
a special residence for you.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:08.819
What…

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:16.994
{\an8}His Majesty the King has arrived!

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:25.627
I'm really going to Bongdeokgung.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.421
I'm at the actual palace.

01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:31.508
I'll be sacrificed instead of
Hong Gyeong-dal's granddaughter.

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:34.136
Does that mean
I prevented the Gapshin Literati Purge?

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:36.638
What do I do now?

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.934
This truly is Hell Joseon.

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:05.250
Consort Kang, did I keep you waiting?

01:15:06.543 --> 01:15:11.715
Your Majesty, I almost turned to dust
and blew away, awaiting your return.

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:15.219
I am glad you are here.

01:15:15.802 --> 01:15:17.346
I wish to show you something.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.223
Come with me.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.227
What is he doing?

01:15:23.977 --> 01:15:25.687
Don't come any closer.

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:28.273
Stay away!

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:33.153
It is her.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:34.488
Gwinyeo.

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:35.531
Pardon?

01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:37.282
Gwinyeo?

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:43.497
Was she brought here as a criminal?

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.707
Yes, she is indeed a criminal.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.963
However, she has a talent
I do not wish to waste by killing her.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:58.470
I am surprised that you brought a woman
to the palace yourself, Your Majesty.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.306
This is the first time this has happened
since I, Kang Mok-ju, was brought here.

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:03.600
"Woman"?

01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:05.435
She is a ghost.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.064
Kang Mok-ju?

01:16:09.147 --> 01:16:11.608
The most villainous woman
in all of Joseon,

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:15.696
who wrapped Yeonhuigun around her finger
and caused all sorts of tyranny?

01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.491
This is just crazy.

01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:26.081
She is not Governor Hong's granddaughter.

01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:27.416
Who is she?

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:28.625
My goodness.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.294
Look at those cat eyes,

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:32.212
shooting out laser beams.

01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:34.673
She could easily burn a hole in my face.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:39.428
She has a pretty face.

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:42.556
His Majesty must be fond of her.

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:49.229
She will look pretty decent
if groomed properly.

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:52.733
Shall I take her to Jahongwon
and teach her what she must know?

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.361
- You cannot do that.
- Pardon?

01:16:57.529 --> 01:16:59.615
She is not that kind of woman.

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:02.117
She is not meant for Jahongwon.

01:17:03.243 --> 01:17:05.579
Then what will you do with her?

01:17:08.373 --> 01:17:09.458
Jeez, that stings!

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:10.834
That look almost killed me.

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:14.630
You will find out in due time.

01:17:25.432 --> 01:17:27.517
No. Don't do this.

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:32.064
No, you can't do this here.

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.524
She's watching!

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:37.694
You will cling to me then…

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.865
and beg for your life.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:48.205
Oh, I have the chills.
Is he going to torture me or something?

01:17:49.122 --> 01:17:51.792
I'm getting chills all over.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.620
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:31.832
{\an8}I am certain His Majesty took an interest
in that wench.

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:34.876
{\an8}Starting today,

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.462
{\an8}you are to cook for me
every day without fail.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:40.048
{\an8}If the food is not to my liking,

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:41.925
{\an8}you will be sentenced to death.

01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:45.011
{\an8}Before you get into huge trouble
and are humiliated…

01:18:45.095 --> 01:18:48.432
{\an8}- I must set a trap in the royal kitchen.
- A snake!

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:50.267
{\an8}You set this up, didn't you?

01:18:51.518 --> 01:18:52.686
{\an8}I have…

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.355
{\an8}- You cannot, Your Grace.
- Step aside!

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:56.940
{\an8}…chosen you.

01:18:57.023 --> 01:18:58.442
{\an8}For what?

01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:06.658
