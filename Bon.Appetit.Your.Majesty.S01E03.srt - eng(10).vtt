00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.436
Your Majesty, the wind is cold.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.188
You should head to your chambers.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.397
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.815
All right. We shall go.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.610
Wait, Your Majesty.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.072
Can you tell us where we're…

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.698
{\an8}KANG MOK-JU
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT, YI HEON'S CONCUBINE

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.033
…headed?

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.577
Why do you ask? Are you afraid?

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.828
Of course I am.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.207
Everything around me
is unfamiliar and scary right now.

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:27.087
SHIN SU-HYEOK
COMMANDER OF URIMWI

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.090
What the heck?

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.302
How is that?

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:37.555
Are your surroundings
less unfamiliar and scary now?

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:41.434
Yes. I can't see anything now,
so there's nothing to fear.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.393
Thanks a lot.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:45.063
What a remarkably fresh approach.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.777
I have prepared
a special residence for you.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.446
You may look forward to it.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.115
I will.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.034
We shall go.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:08.503
In this era, is it natural and ordinary
for the king to do as he pleases?

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:11.131
I told you to watch what you say!

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:40.493
How is His Majesty?

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.081
An unknown ointment
was applied to the wound,

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.374
which seems to have stopped the bleeding.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.920
Any delay and His Majesty's life
could have been in grave danger.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.130
The heavens protected him.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.717
It is greatly fortunate
that it was not any worse, Your Majesty.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.886
If the bleeding had not been stopped,

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.221
my life could have been in danger?

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.389
What's your problem?

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.308
Don't you see
that I stopped the bleeding for you?

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.143
I saved your life!

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.273
Very well. You may all leave.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.566
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.991
You must forget every detail
of what you saw and heard in here today.

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:21.784
Yes, Your Grace.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.592
It was truly a close call, Your Majesty.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:41.262
May I ask who stopped
the bleeding from the wound?

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:43.306
It was the gwinyeo.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.682
The gwinyeo?

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.435
Did you bring her here
because she saved your life,

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:49.729
not because she committed a crime?

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:51.397
That is partially why.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.900
However, no one in all of Joseon

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.570
wants to kill her as much as I do.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.365
It has been a while
since I last saw you look that amused.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.659
Are you perhaps bothered about that?

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.495
Is the great Consort Kang bothered?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:09.415
Oh, please. Why would I be?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.003
Earlier, you said you prepared
a special residence for her.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.422
{\an8}It is not a byeolgung, is it?

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.966
{\an8}BYEOLGUNG: SPECIAL RESIDENCE
FOR THE KING'S FUTURE BRIDE OR CONCUBINE

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:18.883
{\an8}Byeolgung?

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:22.262
Or did you prepare a special residence
outside the palace?

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.514
Are you jealous?

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.392
Stop teasing me

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.936
and tell me what is happening.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.563
Go on.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.484
Do not worry.

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:39.237
Her residence

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.657
is much more special than a byeolgung.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.086
You know,

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.338
I didn't expect a five-star hotel,

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.882
but this is what he meant
by "special residence"?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:03.761
He meant a tiny prison
in the corner of the palace.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.472
He even has a prison in the palace.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.058
What an amazing guy, huh?

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.893
These may be mourning clothes,

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:14.480
but at least they gave us clean clothes
and let us bathe.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.650
We survived the ordeal,
so let us be satisfied with that.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.360
You're right.

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.529
We did survive.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.490
So far, that is.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:32.206
COURSE N° 3 HAUTE CUISINE

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.584
{\an8}The prison?

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:39.213
{\an8}He acts extremely strangely
for someone who wants to kill her.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.508
{\an8}I am certain His Majesty
took an interest in that wench.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.344
{\an8}It is nothing but a fleeting curiosity,
Your Grace.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.180
{\an8}It is also odd how he calls her a gwinyeo.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:50.349
{\an8}She surely did not just fall from the sky.
Where on earth did she come from?

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.644
{\an8}Find out all you can about that wench,
and spare no detail.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.146
{\an8}How they met,

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.440
{\an8}and how she caught His Majesty's eye
at the Gyeonggi Governor's Office.

00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:01.611
{\an8}Would it not be faster
to inquire of the Chief Royal Secretary?

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:04.280
{\an8}You are right. I forgot about Im Song-jae.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.324
{\an8}Shall I send word, Your Grace?

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:08.618
{\an8}Yes. Let him know I wish to see him.

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:10.745
{\an8}Also…

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.542
Send this to Grand Prince Jesan.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.710
Yes, Your Grace.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:27.053
{\an8}ROYAL KITCHEN:
THE PLACE WHERE ROYAL MEALS ARE PREPARED

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.811
The medicinal herbs we got today
are nice and fresh.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.067
EOM BONG-SIK
SEVENTH-RANK SENIOR COOK

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:44.862
Can you not pound that harder?

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.656
Do not waste a single grain of rice.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.368
Watch the blade
so you do not cut yourself.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.369
Yes, sir.

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:52.870
Cook Sim.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.875
The batter needs more water.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:58.876
Yes, sir.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.630
- Cook Min.
- Yes?

00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:05.424
This is not the color you want
your buchimgae to have.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.678
Pan-fry them until they turn golden yellow
so they look appetizing.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.596
- Yes, sir.
- Goodness me.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.891
Let me have a look.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.770
Look all you want.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.110
By the way, have you all heard the news?

00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:27.738
His Majesty returned to the palace
with some gwinyeo.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.323
A ginyeo?

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:32.452
What courtesan house is she from
that His Majesty fancied her?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.872
{\an8}Gosh, you fool.
He said "gwinyeo," not "ginyeo."

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:40.042
It is a ghost
who took the form of a woman.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.753
Yes, Cook Sim is right.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.923
His Majesty brought back a ghostly woman.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:51.137
Is it not time that you stopped caring
about palace rumors?

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.305
Do you not have work to do?

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.641
It would be strange and wrong not to know

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.977
about a rumor on everyone's mind
at the palace.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.688
{\an8}Is it because you came from the kitchen
in Waegwan, a Japanese village?

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.983
{\an8}You have a closed and narrow mind.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:09.155
I see now. It is because you are
a third-generation cook

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:12.200
that you are so sensitive
about palace rumors.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.744
Did you not know, Cook Maeng?

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.662
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager's
Senior Court Lady Kim

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.998
and Cook Eom
are more than just acquainted.

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:22.084
That is how he is the first to know
what is going on in the palace.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:24.712
That is why the Grand Royal Queen Dowager

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.006
will support him as the next chief royal--

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:30.635
You fool. Will you shut your mouth?

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:32.512
What if someone were to hear?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.433
There is no one here to hear but us.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.727
Did you drink again last night?

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.312
Stop drinking so much!

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:46.484
{\an8}Anyway, I believe you will be
the next chief royal cook.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.821
We never know.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.158
It could be Cook Maeng for all you know.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.911
It has not been long since the former
chief royal cook passed away,

00:08:56.994 --> 00:08:59.997
and you are already discussing
his replacement?

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.667
Watch what you say
if you wish to at least stay

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.252
and eat His Majesty's leftovers.

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.880
What is wrong with talking about
something that came up already?

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.591
Are you disgruntled that you will not be
the next chief royal cook?

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.510
That is enough, Cook Sim.

00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:15.429
Why would you taunt Cook Maeng like that?

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.014
So what if he is upset?

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.391
It is the truth.

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.476
He can try all he wants,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.437
but you, Cook Eom,
should head the royal kitchen next.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.231
You never know.

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:29.694
Greetings, Eunuch Yoon.

00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:31.821
Her Grace Consort Kang

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:34.907
believes Cook Maeng is the best cook.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.158
Speaking of,

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.745
the former chief royal cook
passed over a fortnight ago.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.248
It is time His Majesty
appointed a replacement.

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.584
Yes, that is true.

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:45.668
Greetings, all.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:50.798
My lady.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:54.010
Please speak, Head Senior Court Lady Kim.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.015
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.100
would like hangwa, rice confections,
as a snack.

00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:02.476
Consort Kang requested samhapjuk,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.146
porridge with three ingredients,
for her late-night refreshment.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.316
- Yes, my lady.
- Yes, my lady.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:16.032
Do not waste the ingredients.

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.492
- Yes, of course not.
- We will not.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:20.411
{\an8}He brought back a gwinyeo?

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:21.329
{\an8}On top of that,

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:24.915
he punished Gyeonggi Governor
Hong Gyeong-dal for high treason?

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:30.921
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:32.423
Governor Hong?

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:34.884
He is the one who compared Consort Kang

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.011
to Yang Guifei, Tang Dynasty Emperor
Xuanzong's consort, is he not?

00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:38.804
Yes, that is him.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.686
Is His Majesty

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:50.775
truly acting out of personal vengeance?

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:54.987
Where is Consort Kang?

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.495
It is her. Gwinyeo.

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:06.040
I have prepared
a special residence for you.

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.542
A gwinyeo?

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.169
There is no way His Majesty

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:13.339
would bring someone like her
unless she has connections.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:14.757
Who could it be?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.135
Your Grace,
the Chief Royal Secretary is here.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:19.220
Let him enter.

00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:31.857
Your Grace,
I hope you have been in good health.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.568
I have. Thank you for your concern.

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:39.031
I heard you failed to bring Mi-hyang
for the chaehong in the end.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.074
I did.

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.452
However, her grandfather Governor Hong
has been exiled, as you wished,

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.913
and his family has become
government-owned slaves.

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:46.997
Then,

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.167
why did you return with that gwinyeo?

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.045
Oh, that girl?

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.714
That was His Majesty's decision.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.466
I know nothing about it,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.844
so I am afraid
I have no explanation for you, Your Grace.

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:06.058
I see. So it was you.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.605
His Majesty made a decision
that even you were not privy to.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:12.940
That is shocking.

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:16.360
I heard she is a good cook.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.404
However, she is nothing but a cook.

00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:21.198
I believe this is not worthy
of your concern, Your Grace.

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:23.159
Is that so?

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:25.911
What did you bring me?

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.664
This is jewelry confiscated
from Governor Hong's residence.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.088
Is this all you collected
on this round of the chaehong?

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.134
Of course not.

00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:43.596
Once we finish organizing
the slaves and property deeds--

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.139
Locate Governor Hong's family

00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:47.725
that have become slaves
and send them all to Jahongwon.

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:51.187
If you go that far,
the officials will oppose.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.647
There are already talks
about Governor Hong's exile.

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.608
That is exactly why.

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.652
You should be smart and quick
to act before I instruct you

00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:01.489
if you do not want
any issues in the future.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.828
Are you certain
that would not pose a problem?

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.079
I am certain indeed.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.833
How dare you question me
after neglecting your duties?

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.044
If that is what you wish,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.087
I will do as you say.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:20.007
This is what you have always done.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.051
Yes, Your Grace.

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:24.261
I will obey.

00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:26.931
Father.

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:29.558
It seems to be time
to come up with a new plan.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.268
What do you mean by that?

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:34.813
Consort Kang
has abused His Majesty's favor

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:37.858
to treat us
like her personal servants for years.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.860
How dare she order me,
a third-rank senior official, around

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.779
when she is merely
a fourth-rank junior consort?

00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:43.531
Watch your mouth!

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.785
Have you forgotten
that we are in the palace?

00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:50.287
If living in this luxury
were a servant's life,

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:53.082
I would willingly be one
for hundreds of decades.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.000
If you insist on being a servant,

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.503
how about we switch masters this time?

00:13:57.586 --> 00:13:59.338
You do not mean that gwinyeo, do you?

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:00.756
Do not be ridiculous!

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:05.761
His Majesty does not care for any woman
other than Consort Kang.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.304
Even that sly nine-tailed fox

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.974
is of low birth if you think about it.

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:13.018
Who is to say a gwinyeo
cannot become like Consort Kang?

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.229
How will you handle the consequences?

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:18.607
I have arranged a new playground
for His Majesty.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.693
You will soon see for yourself

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:23.320
who His Majesty's heart is leaning toward.

00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:50.890
Who are you?

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:52.641
If we get caught, we all die.

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:56.270
Do not make a sound.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:59.315
The keys?

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.488
Come on.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.544
The criminals escaped.
Search the palace thoroughly!

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.545
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.017
The criminals escaped. Find the gwinyeo!

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.145
Let's go.

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:44.276
What are we doing
in the middle of the night?

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.159
Look at the sky.

00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:53.285
My gosh.

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:55.371
It is so beautiful.

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.627
They reported
that the gwinyeo has escaped.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.755
It seems that His Majesty
is making his way to that place.

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:14.264
Let us go!

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.686
Here it goes!

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:23.232
This is fun!

00:16:26.443 --> 00:16:27.277
Come and play!

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.782
This is great!

00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:36.036
Come on!

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:41.583
This is fun!

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:43.711
Come on!

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:47.423
This is great fun!

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.059
Gil-geum, who are all these people?

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.602
I have no idea.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:03.689
They look like performers,
but why are they here?

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.567
And where did that man go?

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.152
Everyone is wearing the same mask,

00:17:08.235 --> 00:17:10.154
- so I can't tell who's who.
- I think this is the man.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.077
My gosh!

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.499
So,

00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.710
did you enjoy the moonlit stroll?

00:17:27.337 --> 00:17:29.298
What are you doing?

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.884
- You said you'd help us escape!
- Exactly!

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:33.302
Will you let us go now?

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:35.804
Let you go?

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.732
Your Majesty.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.150
Your Majesty…

00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:56.200
I prepared this performance
especially for you.

00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:58.577
I wonder if you enjoyed it.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.663
Wait, then who was the masked guy
from earlier?

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.248
You there, Gong-gil.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.628
Everyone, stop!

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.218
Do you mean him?

00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:16.887
What? You were in on it together?

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.597
You did well today, as usual.

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.766
It is my pleasure, Your Majesty.

00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:29.733
GONG-GIL
YEONHUIGUN'S JESTER WITH MANY SECRETS

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:35.906
Oh my, look at that scoundrel.

00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:39.576
He is very tall and handsome.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.954
That's not the point, Gil-geum.

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.580
He tricked us.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:47.167
I would willingly
be deceived by him again.

00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:49.044
- What got into you?
- This man

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.589
is an actor I cherish greatly.

00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:54.007
His name is Gong-gil.

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.175
He's an actor?

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:58.971
Yes. His mask dance, Cheoyongmu,
is simply exquisite, is it not?

00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:01.348
Yes, it is.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:03.267
You may go now.

00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:06.937
Were you entertained, Your Majesty?

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.357
I was much more entertained tonight
than usual.

00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:14.987
Here you go!

00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:24.121
Thank you for your generosity,
Your Majesty!

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:31.170
Tonight, we shall drink
until we cannot see straight!

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.423
Let us go and drink!

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.638
Let us go!

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.599
- My word.
- Wait.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.851
Where did I hear
the name "Gong-gil" before?

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.688
The court jester, Gong-gil.
The movie The King and the Clown!

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.858
I have heard rumors about him,

00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:55.777
but he certainly brings joy to the eye.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.823
Get a grip, Gil-geum.

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:01.575
We are eating meat today!

00:20:01.658 --> 00:20:04.745
- Come along!
- Let us play some more!

00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:06.455
Have some fun!

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:18.592
I was struck by an assassin's arrow
in Salgoji Forest.

00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:20.469
Discreetly find out who was behind it.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:27.100
Why are you going this far?

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.310
For fun.

00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:30.395
Why do you ask?

00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:32.439
Did you not enjoy it?

00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:35.817
You put way too much effort
into simply having fun,

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.611
that I didn't even have the chance
to be entertained.

00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:39.488
If you try to run away again,

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.742
I will not let you off with a smile.

00:20:45.118 --> 00:20:49.248
All will be well as long as you don't send
that masked fool.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.415
How dare you.

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:52.501
Must you always have the final word?

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:55.587
Do you truly not wish to live anymore?

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.216
Guards! Is the iron nice and hot?

00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:00.509
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.147
You said this was just for fun.

00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:16.858
I told you to control your temper.

00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:19.278
That wouldn't have made any difference.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:22.906
I knew it would get us in trouble one day.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.616
Start with her.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.493
- Me?
- What?

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:29.288
- Miss!
- Wait.

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:30.872
Gil-geum!

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.208
Miss!

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.127
Gil-geum!

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.087
Miss!

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.841
- Miss!
- Oh no.

00:21:44.177 --> 00:21:45.137
Miss.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.305
Your Majesty.

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:49.975
Please hear us out.

00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:52.561
You were so insolent just a moment ago.

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.187
Did you change your mind?

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.106
Insolent? Who, me?

00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:59.651
I will never run away again.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.445
Will that do?

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.447
You will not?

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:06.700
That is good to hear.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:10.245
It would have been a shame
to let you go like this.

00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.040
Release the girl.

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:14.458
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:27.971
Your Majesty.

00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:31.683
Will you send us back to prison now?

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:33.477
Of course not.

00:22:34.644 --> 00:22:37.481
I am extremely famished right now.

00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:40.233
Prepare me something to eat.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:42.569
Unbelievable.

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:45.572
So he still wants my food, huh?

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:50.744
Miss, hurry up and answer him.

00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:53.747
Okay.

00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:55.832
I'll get to it right away.

00:22:56.958 --> 00:23:00.045
But I must make a request first.

00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:01.797
A request, you say?

00:23:04.508 --> 00:23:07.260
Let Gil-geum be my assistant cook.

00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:08.887
I cannot manage on my own.

00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:16.311
Very well.

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:17.896
In return,

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:21.525
I expect you to cook with all your heart
and do your absolute best.

00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:23.318
It will take much more
than the boiled beef you made

00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:25.987
back at the Gyeonggi Governor's Office
to satisfy me.

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:33.662
Is there a particular dish you'd like,
Your Majesty?

00:23:34.454 --> 00:23:36.164
A dish I would like?

00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:41.795
"Those who seek to live will die,
and those who seek to die shall live."

00:23:42.712 --> 00:23:45.423
If you serve what you did before
to save your life,

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:47.092
you will die.

00:23:47.175 --> 00:23:49.010
If you cook something new
with your life on the line,

00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:51.096
you will live.

00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:55.142
Only if the food satisfies me, that is.

00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:16.413
Miss.

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:20.542
I am pleased
to finally enter the royal kitchen,

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.002
but will we be all right?

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:23.795
No.

00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:25.797
Gil-geum.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:29.551
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to survive and go home.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.722
I'm going to reunite with my dad,

00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:38.101
and I'm going to eat with him…

00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:40.687
You must stay strong,
especially at times like this.

00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:44.107
I will also do whatever it takes
to survive

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.319
and become the senior court lady
of the royal kitchen.

00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:51.072
Okay, Gil-geum.

00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:53.700
I will try to stay strong.

00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:57.621
Oh dear, miss.

00:24:57.704 --> 00:24:59.206
I can't believe this.

00:24:59.915 --> 00:25:02.667
Oh my, miss, what is the matter?

00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:05.629
Why are you crying? Are you all right?

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.716
Stop crying.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.635
Thank you, Gil-geum.

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:18.391
I aced a cooking competition, you know.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.976
You faced it?

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.686
I mean, I got the highest score.

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:24.856
The harder the mission, the better I do.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.941
So don't worry.

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:27.734
You are so amazing.

00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:30.028
Let's do this.

00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:31.154
Yes, we can do this.

00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:34.950
Pardon? Let a woman prepare
the royal meal?

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:37.327
You are taking your joke too far,
Chief Eunuch.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.453
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:41.498
{\an8}CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD:
THE HEAD OF THE ROYAL KITCHEN EUNUCHS

00:25:41.581 --> 00:25:43.375
{\an8}What can I say?

00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:45.502
It was His Majesty's command.

00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:48.797
Is the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
aware of this?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.090
Silence.

00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:52.509
The Chief Eunuch came in person.

00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:54.928
Do you not understand
the gravity of the situation?

00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:58.056
{\an8}But a woman can work as a maid
in the royal kitchen

00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:00.225
{\an8}or a court lady on palace grounds.

00:26:00.308 --> 00:26:02.018
I can tell at a glance

00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:05.480
that your roots differ
from those of the cooks here.

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:07.065
Where did you learn to cook?

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:08.775
At an entertainment house
like Myeongwolgwan?

00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:16.616
Well, the place I worked at

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.537
is quite far away from here,
so you wouldn't know even if I told you.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.039
Are you from Sichuan in Ming? Or Waegwan?

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:24.374
Where?

00:26:24.457 --> 00:26:26.668
Did you learn to cook
in some barbarian country?

00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:30.046
No. Well, I was--

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.798
You are all so harsh.

00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:35.844
Why are you questioning things
when it is His Majesty's command?

00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:48.356
Hey, wait.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.733
- Excuse me?
- Wait up.

00:26:49.816 --> 00:26:54.321
My gosh. You people are so unfriendly.

00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:57.657
You know what?
This is how things should be in a kitchen.

00:26:57.741 --> 00:26:59.326
All right then.

00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:01.828
How about we get warmed up?

00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:12.422
Chief Eunuch,
allow me to apologize on behalf of them.

00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:14.716
His Majesty has specifically asked
for that cook,

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:17.469
so be sure
to let the other cooks know of this.

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:18.845
Yes, Chief Eunuch.

00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.474
Goodbye.

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:41.159
They have a great fire going.

00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:44.913
There are so many of them.

00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:52.504
Wait. This is it?

00:27:57.675 --> 00:28:00.512
I'll substitute cassia bark for cinnamon

00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:03.473
and myoga for onions.

00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:06.393
Cassia bark for cinnamon

00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:08.686
and myoga for onions?

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:09.646
Yeah.

00:28:09.729 --> 00:28:10.730
They don't have them here,

00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:12.899
but those are popular ingredients
used in the future.

00:28:12.982 --> 00:28:14.067
Oh, the future?

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.860
Okay. Let's do this.

00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:16.778
Let us do this.

00:28:20.156 --> 00:28:21.116
Miss.

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:24.577
I smell raw meat somewhere.

00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:25.703
Raw meat?

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.706
I don't smell anything.

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.717
You really have the nose of a dog.

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:48.351
Why would you taste that
without knowing what it is?

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:52.105
- It's not beef.
- What?

00:28:52.772 --> 00:28:53.648
Deer?

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.066
Is it deer meat?

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.486
Mister, was there deer meat here?

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.821
Deer?

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:01.114
Oh, right.

00:29:01.197 --> 00:29:04.325
The deer His Majesty hunted yesterday
was cleaned and sent

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.869
to Saongwon, Office of Royal Meals.

00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:10.749
Deer meat…

00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:13.543
What is it, miss?

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:17.672
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.841
Deer steak is my specialty.

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:21.885
Deer stack?

00:29:21.968 --> 00:29:23.052
Take note of the recipe.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.555
First of all…

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:23.488
Is this how you will serve the food?

00:30:23.571 --> 00:30:26.115
- Yes.
- This is a disaster.

00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:28.868
Quickly set two tables,
one for His Majesty and one for tasting.

00:30:28.952 --> 00:30:29.953
- Yes, sir.
- So?

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:33.498
Are you saying the woman His Majesty
brought back took over the royal kitchen?

00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.417
Yes, exactly.
Do you think this is acceptable?

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.336
This is so unfair.

00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:39.295
My goodness!

00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:42.799
What did you just say?

00:30:42.882 --> 00:30:45.134
His Majesty brought back a gwinyeo

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.470
and sent her to the royal kitchen?

00:30:47.554 --> 00:30:48.388
Yes.

00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:52.308
She is preparing a meal with the meat
from the deer His Majesty caught.

00:30:52.392 --> 00:30:53.268
What?

00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:55.061
Deer meat?

00:31:02.277 --> 00:31:04.195
The gwinyeo was appointed
as a special cook?

00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:07.490
Are you saying she really cooks?

00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:08.908
Yes, Your Grace.

00:31:10.493 --> 00:31:12.579
Do you know
what His Majesty made her cook?

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:14.163
I do not.

00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:17.709
But how could a woman possibly prepare
a decent royal meal?

00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:20.378
The result is as clear as day.

00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:23.798
He is extremely picky and sensitive
when it comes to food.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.593
I cannot believe it.

00:31:27.176 --> 00:31:28.386
From what I heard,

00:31:28.469 --> 00:31:30.638
the gwinyeo cooked
at the Gyeonggi Governor's Office,

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.515
and His Majesty enjoyed it.

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:34.559
At the Gyeonggi Governor's Office?

00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:36.603
She cooked there?

00:31:36.686 --> 00:31:37.520
Yes, Your Grace.

00:31:37.604 --> 00:31:41.107
However, it is highly unlikely
that a woman has properly learned to cook.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.902
She will not last long just by knowing
how to make a few decent side dishes.

00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:46.279
After the gwinyeo finishes cooking,

00:31:46.362 --> 00:31:48.114
you must see for yourself.

00:31:48.197 --> 00:31:50.658
Find whatever fault or flaw you can.

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:52.702
Yes, Your Grace.

00:31:57.206 --> 00:31:59.042
- Chu-wol.
- Yes, Your Grace.

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:04.172
Is His Majesty in his chambers?

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:05.423
Yes, Your Grace.

00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:08.509
I must see him immediately.
Let us get ready.

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:09.928
Yes, Your Grace.

00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:20.730
{\an8}Change into this.

00:32:20.813 --> 00:32:22.023
{\an8}GANGNYEONGJEON

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:23.358
{\an8}What? Into these clothes?

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.526
Hurry up. Walk faster.

00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:29.197
Hurry up.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.281
Now stand here.

00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:32.367
The food is getting cold.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.868
- Right.
- Let me see.

00:32:36.913 --> 00:32:37.914
You are ready.

00:32:37.997 --> 00:32:38.998
Stand over there.

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:41.960
Your Majesty.

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.253
Your seoksura, evening meal, is ready.

00:32:45.046 --> 00:32:46.130
Bring it in.

00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:04.649
Why is a grown man not dressed properly?

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.110
Relax.

00:33:16.786 --> 00:33:17.745
CHOI MAL-IM
KING'S SENIOR COURT LADY

00:33:21.082 --> 00:33:22.125
Oh, right.

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:36.014
I see you brought the food.

00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:43.980
Stay alert.

00:33:44.063 --> 00:33:45.940
He might be Joseon's worst tyrant,

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:47.900
but I know history.

00:33:47.984 --> 00:33:49.569
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:50.945
What are you doing?

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:52.613
{\an8}Explain the eoseon.

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:53.698
{\an8}EOSEON: MEAL PREPARED FOR THE KING

00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:01.539
Your Majesty.

00:34:02.081 --> 00:34:05.460
This is a meal rooted in the royal cuisine
of the Palace of Versailles,

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:08.087
known as haute cuisine,
or traditional French cooking.

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:10.882
{\an8}FRENCH GOURMET COURSE MEAL

00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:13.843
"Trench"? "Oat sheen"?

00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:18.222
It's pronounced "haute cuisine."

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:34.363
{\an8}First, I prepared an hors d'oeuvre
to boost your appetite.

00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:37.617
{\an8}It's steak tartare topped
with various vegetables and raw egg yolk

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.702
{\an8}served with kelp chips.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:41.746
"Older"?

00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:44.248
"Taro taro"?

00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:48.586
I have never seen raw meat
shaped this way.

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:50.838
{\an8}Steak tartare

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.715
{\an8}is truly an older dish.

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.052
Are you mocking me?

00:34:56.135 --> 00:34:57.553
Would I dare?

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:04.060
Do you suggest I eat this first?

00:35:04.143 --> 00:35:06.646
You should eat that with this.

00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:09.982
This tastes best
when mixed right before you eat it.

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:38.886
This is what we call "tableside service."

00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:41.722
Watching and enjoying
the food being prepared before your eyes

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.349
stimulates the appetite.

00:35:50.356 --> 00:35:51.357
Please try it.

00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:54.902
{\an8}Taste the food.

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:55.820
{\an8}Yes, Your Majesty.

00:36:13.796 --> 00:36:14.839
Please try it.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.356
Wait.

00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:34.317
What is this taste?

00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:06.891
It is the same raw meat I have had,

00:37:06.974 --> 00:37:09.268
but this tastes richer and sweeter.

00:37:12.188 --> 00:37:13.231
How interesting.

00:37:14.982 --> 00:37:16.442
How should I describe it?

00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:18.945
It is powerful but shy,

00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:21.989
and it leaves a lingering taste
on my tongue.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.953
Next is the potage.

00:37:28.537 --> 00:37:31.624
{\an8}I made a thick milk porridge with peas.

00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:36.337
"Botage"?

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.971
It has a peculiar color and aroma.

00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:48.349
What is more important
when it comes to food, Your Majesty?

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:50.643
The taste or the aroma?

00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:51.811
Would it not be the taste?

00:37:52.395 --> 00:37:53.729
I believe the aroma is more important.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:55.856
Why is that?

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.233
When it comes to taste,

00:37:57.316 --> 00:38:00.152
you can only sense the five basic types,
which are bitter, sour, sweet,

00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:01.362
spicy, and salty.

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:03.489
But aromas are countless and diverse.

00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:06.826
You have a point.

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:09.537
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:11.956
Allow me.

00:39:03.924 --> 00:39:05.968
This aroma is not extravagant,

00:39:06.969 --> 00:39:09.096
but it is subtle and fresh

00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:11.599
and has a clean taste.

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:15.561
Like peas glistening in the morning sun

00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:17.980
and bursting out of the pods one by one.

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:19.857
Right?

00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:21.692
That was very well said.

00:39:22.276 --> 00:39:23.569
That is truly astute.

00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:27.114
Now, it is time for the main dish.

00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:32.370
{\an8}The highlight of haute cuisine, viande.

00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:35.206
{\an8}THE MAIN COURSE, A MEAT DISH

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.920
The behind of oat sheen?

00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:42.880
For goodness' sake.

00:39:42.963 --> 00:39:44.423
What should I do with you?

00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:52.473
It feels like you are mocking me again.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.642
This is also just raw meat.

00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:58.938
This is deer tongue.

00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:00.815
It's not meant to be eaten raw.

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:03.067
I'll grill it for you here.

00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:11.075
Slightly grilling both sides
on a charcoal fire

00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:15.287
enhances the texture
as well as the flavor and aroma.

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:19.417
I have eaten deer
prepared in various ways,

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.628
but this is a method
I have never seen before.

00:40:22.711 --> 00:40:26.048
Historically speaking,
deer represented the king,

00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:29.218
and its tongue was considered
one of the eight delicacies,

00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:31.011
a very rare ingredient to come by.

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.471
I am surprised
that you know of such a thing.

00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:35.641
{\an8}That's why the fight for royal power
is called chukrok, no?

00:40:35.724 --> 00:40:36.934
{\an8}CHUKROK: CHASING THE DEER

00:40:37.017 --> 00:40:38.352
{\an8}You are quite intelligent.

00:40:45.484 --> 00:40:48.946
Her skill is beyond anything of this time.

00:40:49.029 --> 00:40:52.241
Where in the world
did this woman come from?

00:40:53.909 --> 00:40:58.414
An unquenchable desire for power,
extreme narcissism,

00:40:58.497 --> 00:41:00.499
and an acute sense of taste.

00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:03.752
This is the best meal to satisfy

00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:05.546
all of Yeonhuigun's desires.

00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:08.757
Where did you learn to make all this?

00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:11.969
I know it's hard to believe,

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:14.847
but as I told you before,
I'm from the future.

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:16.640
I'm serious.

00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:24.482
It is truly a shame
that you are still not in your right mind.

00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:26.442
I would believe you
if you said you were from

00:41:26.525 --> 00:41:29.111
a distant barbarian land or an island.

00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:31.906
Nonetheless,

00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:34.283
I am pleased…

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.454
with the first royal meal you served.

00:41:39.955 --> 00:41:43.209
I'm glad you at least like my food.

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:48.297
Your Majesty, I will taste the food.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.423
No.

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:53.344
You taste it this time.

00:41:53.427 --> 00:41:55.262
Pardon? Me?

00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:02.603
Okay, sure.

00:42:26.252 --> 00:42:28.087
DEPOSED QUEEN YEON
YI HEON'S BIRTH MOTHER

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.130
Now, you have a bite, Crown Prince.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.222
It is delicious, Mother.

00:42:44.853 --> 00:42:45.729
Now,

00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:48.774
give me a piece.

00:42:48.857 --> 00:42:50.109
Pardon?

00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:56.782
Are you asking me to feed you?

00:42:57.366 --> 00:42:58.367
Do you not want to?

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:01.495
No, it's not that.

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.967
How did you see into my heart?

00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.094
Sorry?

00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:00.804
How did you know

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:03.349
I would like this dish?

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.476
Actually…

00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:09.188
I studied Yeonhuigun,

00:44:09.271 --> 00:44:11.315
and I won a cooking competition
with this dish.

00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:14.777
I never imagined
I'd get to serve it to you in person.

00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:17.196
How fascinating.

00:44:18.113 --> 00:44:18.947
Yeonhuigun?

00:44:20.074 --> 00:44:21.700
You mentioned that name before.

00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:23.452
Who in the world is this Yeonhuigun?

00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:26.914
Wait, telling him the story
would be too risky.

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.418
Well, you see…

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.671
I can't quite remember right now.

00:44:40.302 --> 00:44:41.387
Let me rephrase my question.

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:45.349
Why did you decide to serve this meal?

00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:46.517
Oh, well…

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.728
I thought about your meals

00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:53.857
and thought it'd be nice to serve
what kings in other countries eat.

00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:57.236
In Europe, kings eat
course meals like this all the time.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:58.904
"Yuleop"?

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:02.116
{\an8}Is that another name
for the Nanman people?

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.617
{\an8}The Nanman people?

00:45:04.993 --> 00:45:09.331
Is "Nanman" the Joseon term for Europe?

00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:16.255
Announce my arrival.

00:45:16.338 --> 00:45:18.048
You cannot enter right now.

00:45:18.132 --> 00:45:19.091
What did you say?

00:45:19.174 --> 00:45:20.717
How dare you stop her?

00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:21.969
Step aside.

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:25.848
Your Grace,
His Majesty is currently tasting

00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:27.724
the new cook's food.

00:45:27.808 --> 00:45:29.351
No one is allowed to enter.

00:45:41.947 --> 00:45:43.407
You cannot, Your Grace.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.700
How dare you!

00:45:44.783 --> 00:45:46.577
Do you not fear the consequences?

00:45:47.494 --> 00:45:49.705
- You cannot, Your Grace.
- Step aside!

00:45:49.788 --> 00:45:51.290
What is this commotion outside?

00:45:51.373 --> 00:45:53.208
I made it clear not to let anyone in.

00:45:56.628 --> 00:45:58.922
Your Majesty, it is I, Consort Kang.

00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:02.259
I brought you
a precious painting from Ming,

00:46:02.342 --> 00:46:06.138
but I seem to have come at a bad time,
so I shall take my leave.

00:46:07.556 --> 00:46:10.934
That would be best.
Return to your chambers.

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:26.950
I think it'd be best if I leave.

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:41.924
You are…

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.595
no ordinary woman.

00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:54.603
Okay, but there's no need
to come this close to my face.

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.025
I have…

00:47:02.236 --> 00:47:03.570
chosen you.

00:47:04.196 --> 00:47:05.531
For what?

00:47:05.614 --> 00:47:07.866
Why would he choose me? What for?

00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:27.469
Does choosing me mean…

00:47:27.553 --> 00:47:29.972
No way. He didn't mean
granting a royal favor, did he?

00:47:30.055 --> 00:47:32.266
No, that can't happen.

00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:36.436
History will change
if I become the king's concubine.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.938
This is driving me crazy.

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.773
Why are you so deep in thought?

00:47:50.158 --> 00:47:52.661
I summoned you
because I have an order for you.

00:47:52.744 --> 00:47:54.871
Of course, this is the palace cliché.

00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:56.081
The king gives commands,

00:47:56.164 --> 00:47:57.874
and the chief royal secretary
gives secret commands.

00:47:59.334 --> 00:48:02.004
- An order?
- Whenever you serve His Majesty,

00:48:02.671 --> 00:48:04.673
tell me everything you learn from him.

00:48:04.756 --> 00:48:07.426
You want me to spy for you for free?

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.972
I apologize, but realistically speaking,
that'd be difficult.

00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:13.724
You know what His Majesty is like.

00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:15.934
He'll kill everyone
if he were to find out,

00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:17.185
and you see,

00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:18.854
I'm chicken-hearted.

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.816
Don't take it to heart. It's not personal.

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:25.068
Do you not think you need an ally here?

00:48:25.152 --> 00:48:27.070
Well, the more allies, the better.

00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:29.698
When you were serving His Majesty
moments ago,

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.950
Consort Kang came by, did she not?

00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:33.201
She did.

00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:36.455
This was the first time
His Majesty sent her away

00:48:36.538 --> 00:48:38.081
over a royal meal.

00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:40.917
Naturally, Consort Kang
will keep a watch on you from now on.

00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:42.002
Just you.

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:44.171
And then she will try to kill you.

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:46.465
That means, without help,

00:48:46.548 --> 00:48:49.051
it will be extremely hard
for you to survive here.

00:48:49.718 --> 00:48:52.471
That's true.
It'd be hard for me to survive.

00:48:52.554 --> 00:48:54.389
He does have great insight.

00:48:54.473 --> 00:48:56.642
This sure is a deal befitting
a top-tier treacherous subject.

00:48:57.225 --> 00:48:59.186
I will support you in secret.

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.605
I will shield you and help you survive.

00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:05.067
But I don't need anyone
to support me in secret.

00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:06.735
What I need is…

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:15.160
In that case, I have a condition.

00:49:15.243 --> 00:49:16.495
- A condition?
- Yes.

00:49:16.578 --> 00:49:18.997
I need you to find something for me.

00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:23.585
If you can promise me that you will,
I'll consider your offer.

00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:26.213
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

00:49:26.713 --> 00:49:28.590
Very well.
What is it that you are looking for?

00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:31.051
- My handbag.
- "Handybag"?

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:32.803
- Yes, my handbag.
- "Handybag."

00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:34.388
You know…

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:38.308
It's the thing you hang on your shoulder
and put things inside.

00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:40.852
What do they call it in this era?

00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:42.771
My handbag is shaped like this.

00:49:42.854 --> 00:49:45.273
- It's called a handbag.
- A handbag.

00:49:45.357 --> 00:49:46.692
A handbag that looks like this.

00:49:46.775 --> 00:49:47.943
A bundle!

00:49:48.443 --> 00:49:50.278
Yes, a bundle.

00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:51.738
You mean your bundle.

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:53.782
Please find my bundle for me.

00:49:53.865 --> 00:49:58.620
It went over the cliff in Salgoji Forest
the day I met His Majesty.

00:49:58.704 --> 00:50:02.290
I need the bundle as it is

00:50:03.458 --> 00:50:04.543
with everything inside.

00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:08.797
Your bundle is all you want?

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:16.805
{\an8}MANGUNROK

00:50:21.893 --> 00:50:23.311
That will do. You can stop.

00:50:24.062 --> 00:50:25.397
Yes, Your Grace.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.941
How could His Majesty do this to me?

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:29.359
Shall I tell Cook Maeng

00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:31.695
to chase the gwinyeo
from the royal kitchen?

00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:33.321
If the cooks act coldly toward her,

00:50:33.405 --> 00:50:35.949
she will not last a day.

00:50:37.784 --> 00:50:39.661
That is a good idea.

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.373
Can you ensure
I will never have to see her again?

00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:46.251
Yes, Your Grace. Leave it to Cook Maeng.

00:50:59.014 --> 00:51:01.183
Dear heavens!

00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:03.310
I have never tasted
anything like this before.

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:05.061
I cannot believe it.

00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:06.855
Gwinyeo!

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:13.528
We cannot live under the same sky.

00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:22.537
What's going on? Is the firewood damp?

00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:25.999
This must be the territorial bullying
I have only heard of.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.126
What is all this smoke?

00:51:29.836 --> 00:51:32.297
Who is making such a mess in the kitchen?

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.298
My gosh.

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:36.510
What's his problem?

00:51:39.304 --> 00:51:41.139
A snake! It's a snake!

00:51:41.223 --> 00:51:43.809
- Gil-geum!
- What is it? What is the matter?

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:48.522
You sneaky little thing. I got you.

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:49.981
Just look at that snake!

00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:54.069
All sorts of things are happening
with a woman in the royal kitchen.

00:51:56.154 --> 00:51:57.197
Gosh, I'm so tired.

00:52:00.575 --> 00:52:01.660
What are those?

00:52:04.746 --> 00:52:06.623
No! Cockroaches!

00:52:06.706 --> 00:52:08.792
Stay calm and let me handle this.

00:52:09.668 --> 00:52:11.837
Where are they coming from?

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:16.049
What are you looking at?

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:18.802
Oh my gosh, these people are crazy!

00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:23.348
I see you had another long day.

00:52:23.932 --> 00:52:24.808
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

00:52:39.698 --> 00:52:40.699
Gil-geum.

00:52:42.117 --> 00:52:45.829
I feel more at ease in here.

00:52:45.912 --> 00:52:47.247
It feels like home.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.124
I wish His Majesty

00:52:49.207 --> 00:52:53.295
would just keep us here all day long.

00:52:53.378 --> 00:52:55.839
Things will be better tomorrow.

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:58.091
To be honest,

00:52:58.174 --> 00:53:00.802
I wish tomorrow would not come.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.681
The cooks are nastier than I expected.

00:53:04.764 --> 00:53:06.182
Their bullying is on a whole other level.

00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:09.060
Should I just tell on them to His Majesty?

00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:11.229
They might all end up dead.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.566
Your Majesty!

00:53:23.366 --> 00:53:24.284
You're right.

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:25.869
It'd be disastrous.

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:28.580
That'd be wrong.

00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:35.545
{\an8}GANGNYEONGJEON

00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:51.019
Your Majesty.

00:53:51.937 --> 00:53:54.230
The Chief Royal Secretary is here.

00:54:02.197 --> 00:54:03.281
What is all that?

00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.075
I am reluctant to inform you,
Your Majesty,

00:54:05.158 --> 00:54:06.493
{\an8}that they are letters of resignation
from the ministers.

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:07.702
{\an8}What?

00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:11.039
What are their reasons?

00:54:11.122 --> 00:54:13.708
They are expressing regret
about your absence

00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:17.420
at the gusikrye, salvation ritual,
and the exile of Gyeonggi Governor Hong.

00:54:18.004 --> 00:54:20.590
Is it a problem to punish a traitor
who committed a crime

00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:23.051
against the king?

00:54:23.134 --> 00:54:24.010
It is not that.

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:26.304
Since Governor Hong
has been exiled for high treason,

00:54:26.388 --> 00:54:28.473
they are petitioning
for the execution of the gwinyeo

00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:30.934
who was captured for the same crime.

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:36.272
It is only right that I decide
when a criminal is punished.

00:54:45.407 --> 00:54:46.825
{\an8}I will go to the hall of governance.

00:54:47.575 --> 00:54:48.702
{\an8}Chief Eunuch.

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.248
Bring Yeon Ji-young
to the hall of governance.

00:54:53.331 --> 00:54:54.708
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:54:57.419 --> 00:54:58.753
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:02.590
- We beg for your understanding.
- We beg for your understanding.

00:55:03.091 --> 00:55:04.259
Your Majesty.

00:55:04.342 --> 00:55:09.139
If Gyeonggi Governor Hong Gyeong-dal
was exiled for insulting you,

00:55:09.222 --> 00:55:11.266
then it is only right that the gwinyeo,

00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:14.853
{\an8}who was captured for treason,
is sentenced to capital punishment.

00:55:14.936 --> 00:55:19.607
Instead, the criminal was sent
to the royal kitchen to cook

00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:21.693
when she should have been
punished severely.

00:55:21.776 --> 00:55:24.029
{\an8}That is outrageously unfair.

00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:25.697
Enough.

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.868
I will not listen to any more of this.

00:55:29.951 --> 00:55:32.579
The cunning woman has stayed alive

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:35.248
{\an8}by deceiving both Your Majesty
and Hong Gyeong-dal,

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:38.752
{\an8}thus causing all these events.

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:41.755
You all are going too far.

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:44.132
Do you think His Majesty

00:55:44.215 --> 00:55:47.427
exiled Hong Gyeong-dal
just because of a mere gwinyeo?

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:52.057
Do you all truly not understand
His Majesty's intent?

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.518
The fact that you petition about
and speak of a treacherous subject

00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:59.272
who insulted His Majesty
is truly a disgrace.

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:01.608
Second Minister of Works
and Chief Royal Secretary,

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:06.321
you two seem to speak as though you deeply
understand His Majesty's mind.

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:12.285
Your antics are an entertaining sight.

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:13.661
Your Majesty.

00:56:13.745 --> 00:56:16.873
We ask that you execute the gwinyeo
who was brought in for humiliating you

00:56:16.956 --> 00:56:19.667
and rescind the penalty of exile
that you commanded

00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:20.919
upon Governor Hong Gyeong-dal.

00:56:21.002 --> 00:56:24.130
- Please consider our request.
- Please consider our request.

00:56:25.757 --> 00:56:27.467
Do you desire a puppet

00:56:28.426 --> 00:56:29.511
for a king?

00:56:34.432 --> 00:56:35.475
Answer me!

00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:38.561
Should I have let the man

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:41.981
who insulted and humiliated me be?

00:56:56.454 --> 00:56:57.413
Yes.

00:56:58.331 --> 00:56:59.207
Very well.

00:56:59.958 --> 00:57:02.043
I will gladly give a command.

00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:08.216
Your Majesty.

00:57:08.299 --> 00:57:12.053
We have brought Yeon Ji-young
of the royal kitchen.

00:57:17.976 --> 00:57:19.727
Well done.

00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:20.645
Thank you.

00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:22.147
I did as you said, Your Grace,

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:24.941
and started the rumor
that Governor Hong Gyeong-dal's exile

00:57:25.024 --> 00:57:26.401
was also the gwinyeo's fault.

00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:30.238
It spread like wildfire
throughout the palace.

00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:31.489
Well done.

00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:35.577
The gwinyeo will soon lose her life.

00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:37.120
Your Majesty,

00:57:37.203 --> 00:57:40.081
you must sentence the gwinyeo
to capital punishment

00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:41.958
and restore order to the throne.

00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:45.378
- Please restore order to the throne.
- Please restore order to the throne.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.219
Heed my words.

00:57:54.053 --> 00:57:55.722
Last night,

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.266
this woman served me a strange dish

00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:59.934
and confused my senses.

00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:09.527
Therefore,

00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:11.696
I command that she be immediately…

00:58:21.372 --> 00:58:23.291
{\an8}appointed as the chief royal cook!

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.001
{\an8}What?

00:58:25.084 --> 00:58:28.671
- What? The chief royal cook?
- The chief royal cook?

00:58:29.756 --> 00:58:30.798
What?

00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:34.511
Starting today,

00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:36.888
you are to cook for me
every day without fail.

00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:38.348
However,

00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:40.475
if you ever serve the same dish
more than once,

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.061
or if it is not to my liking,

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:45.563
you will be sentenced to death.

00:58:51.277 --> 00:58:53.112
As if that sly Consort Kang
was not enough,

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.114
he now favors a gwinyeo
from goodness knows where.

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:57.534
Not to mention how he coddles the woman.

00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.744
We must get rid of her when we can.

00:59:01.412 --> 00:59:05.583
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
will not just stand by and watch.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.964
It was our chance to eliminate

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:13.049
the Grand Royal Queen Dowager's
Han family,

00:59:13.675 --> 00:59:16.553
and His Majesty brought in another woman
whose roots we know nothing of.

00:59:18.179 --> 00:59:19.764
We must drive her out at all costs.

00:59:19.847 --> 00:59:21.849
His Majesty will soon see

00:59:21.933 --> 00:59:24.018
just how troubled a nation becomes

00:59:24.102 --> 00:59:26.354
when its king loses himself in women.

00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:33.403
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

00:59:33.486 --> 00:59:35.029
I did not expect things
to turn out this way.

00:59:35.697 --> 00:59:38.116
His Majesty appointed her
as the chief royal cook himself,

00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:40.159
so I cannot get involved right now.

00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:47.834
It looks like

00:59:48.459 --> 00:59:50.837
I will need someone else's help.

00:59:52.505 --> 00:59:53.423
{\an8}JAGYEONGJEON

00:59:53.506 --> 00:59:56.259
{\an8}To think that you came to visit,
Consort Kang.

00:59:56.342 --> 00:59:58.219
A long life lets you witness wonders.

00:59:58.303 --> 00:59:59.887
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:02.849
I will visit you more often.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.684
You must have a reason

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.145
for coming all the way here.

01:00:07.228 --> 01:00:08.646
What is it?

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:10.398
The truth is,

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:13.109
I am here to discuss the matter
regarding the gwinyeo.

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:14.861
Gwinyeo?

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.613
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:20.241
The cunning wench who is clouding
His Majesty's mind with her cooking skills

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.286
was appointed as the chief royal cook.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:25.455
Like she is not cunning.

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:30.126
What is it that you wish to say?

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.462
She appeared on the day of the eclipse.

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:34.255
Also, the day she appeared,

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:37.967
His Majesty was shot
by an assassin's arrow.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:38.885
What?

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.387
His Majesty was shot?

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:45.058
Why did you not inform me sooner?

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.727
His Majesty commanded my silence,

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.063
so I could not inform you.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.314
However,

01:00:51.397 --> 01:00:54.692
seeing that His Majesty went so far
as to make her the chief royal cook,

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:56.611
I could not simply stand by and watch,

01:00:56.694 --> 01:00:59.280
which is why I came to see you,
Your Royal Highness.

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:03.826
No one knows of her roots or her past.

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:07.705
I am also bothered by her presence,

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:11.000
but I have no authority to interfere
with those in the royal kitchen.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.960
I understand you do not.

01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:16.673
Then how about

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:20.343
you test the gwinyeo's skills yourself,
Your Royal Highness?

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:21.886
Test her?

01:01:22.887 --> 01:01:24.847
That is a great idea.

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:29.060
If you test the gwinyeo and she proves
to be as good as she is rumored to be,

01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:31.396
that should quell
the ministers' opposition.

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:35.108
If she does not, we have the opportunity
to expel her from the palace.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.071
I had heard a great deal

01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:43.700
about the gwinyeo's cooking skills

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:46.452
and was wondering
just how impressive it could be.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:51.582
I await your command, Your Royal Highness.

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:57.422
I will prepare all that is necessary.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.139
You can stay here now.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:18.359
Miss.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:20.361
There are walls.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.780
My gosh. These are actual walls.

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.660
Gil-geum, the floor is heated.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.832
Are those things over there the bedding?

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.083
Oh my!

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:36.669
- Let me see.
- Oh dear.

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:39.839
It is our bedding!

01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:43.259
Gil-geum, you've been through so much.

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:47.638
Things happened, but you became
the chief royal cook in the end.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.140
It feels like a dream.

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:52.477
Whatever the case,
they gave us a proper place to stay.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.061
This is just great!

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:58.483
Who knew we would be treated
to such privilege?

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.402
Miss!

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:07.909
To be honest,
it was getting a bit tough for me.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:10.745
I felt the same.

01:03:10.828 --> 01:03:13.539
How did we end up
meeting that damned tyrant?

01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:15.541
Miss.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.336
You promised to watch your mouth!

01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:20.046
It's fine.

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:22.632
There are walls. No one can hear us.

01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:23.883
They can't hear.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:26.761
You are right. There are walls.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.307
- My goodness.
- Cook Yeon.

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:32.642
Come on out.

01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:39.565
Hello.

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:42.276
Greetings.

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:45.863
I congratulate you
on becoming the chief royal cook.

01:03:47.406 --> 01:03:51.244
Wear those clothes and come
to the royal kitchen starting tomorrow.

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:52.411
Clothes?

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.247
Let me have a look.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.545
Oh my, this is silk.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:03.714
It is incredibly pretty and fancy.

01:04:04.715 --> 01:04:06.968
This is a female cook's uniform, right?

01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:09.053
When did you have this made?

01:04:09.136 --> 01:04:11.514
I will see you tomorrow then.

01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:13.975
Thank you, sir.

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:15.226
You too, Mister Eunuch Yoon.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.562
Thank you.

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:19.772
Miss, let me carry that.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.691
- Let us go.
- It suits you so well.

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:23.776
- Is this how you wear it?
- Yes.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.365
She does not seem sane.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:30.825
Will it be all right?

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:32.285
Watch what you say.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.453
How long have you been a eunuch?

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:37.164
- Do not speak so freely.
- Yes, Chief Eunuch.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:42.086
There are court ladies and maids
in the royal kitchen.

01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:45.089
- But a female chief royal cook?
- That is enough.

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.717
Did you not hear it was His Majesty

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.802
who made a woman the chief royal cook?

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.220
That may be the case,

01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:55.641
but I cannot allow the order
in our kitchen to hit rock bottom.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.560
What will you do then?

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.063
If we cannot chase her away…

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:05.484
we must make her leave voluntarily.

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:26.088
I get to work at the royal kitchen
as a maid thanks to you.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:28.007
My wish came true.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:31.093
Yes. The first day at work
is always exciting.

01:05:31.802 --> 01:05:35.473
I get to work at a palace kitchen,
so I guess it's not all that bad.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:37.725
Will it be all right, miss?

01:05:37.808 --> 01:05:40.937
What if the nasty cooks bully you
or act all territorial again?

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.772
How will we handle that?

01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:45.191
It wasn't my kitchen then.

01:05:46.692 --> 01:05:48.069
Don't worry.

01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:50.279
I won't let them walk over me now.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:58.204
{\an8}Did you mix the salt and flour?

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.957
That is what I am doing right now.

01:06:04.418 --> 01:06:06.671
Cook Maeng, how are the knives looking?

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:09.131
I completely dulled them all
on a whetstone.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.592
They will not even cut through tofu.

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.219
Well done.

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:16.389
Hide all the older sauces
and fermented pastes in the back.

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:17.431
Yes, Cook Eom!

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:21.435
Set aside the best cuts of meat!

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:22.937
- Yes, Cook Eom!
- Yes, Cook Eom!

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:35.533
Greetings, Chief Eunuch and Eunuch Yoon.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.661
You will have heard by now.

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:41.455
This is the new chief royal cook

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:43.958
appointed by His Majesty the King.

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:47.920
Hello.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:51.048
We've met before, but I'd like to
formally introduce myself.

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:52.758
I'm Yeon Ji-young.

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:58.806
And this is Seo Gil-geum,
who will assist me.

01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:01.392
Nice to meet you all.

01:07:04.645 --> 01:07:06.188
I will leave you to your work.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:08.607
Be sure to cook
and serve the meals without fail.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.192
Yes, Chief Eunuch.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.487
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:28.502
I do not know with what skill or talent

01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:31.589
a woman like you secured the position
of chief royal cook,

01:07:31.672 --> 01:07:34.592
but do you know how much responsibility
that position carries?

01:07:34.675 --> 01:07:36.677
The number of people who work
in this royal kitchen per shift is 195,

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:39.889
and since there are two shifts,
that makes a total of 390 people.

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:43.059
You must lead them
without problem or fail,

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.936
and that role belongs to
the sixth-rank junior cook.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.273
In other words,
that is what the chief royal cook does.

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:53.402
He's so eloquent. I didn't miss a word.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:57.573
Anyway, 390 people?

01:07:57.656 --> 01:08:01.660
You have more kitchen staff
than any of the top hotels.

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.746
That's really impressive.

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:05.748
"Hot tail"?

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:06.791
What is that?

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:10.836
Anyway, a novice like you

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.047
cannot handle the responsibility.

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:16.175
Before you get into huge trouble
and are humiliated,

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:18.219
- you should just leave--
- Just a moment.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.558
Who is the highest-ranking person here?

01:08:25.476 --> 01:08:26.310
Who might that be?

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:32.066
Other than me, the chief royal cook.

01:08:34.485 --> 01:08:35.694
That would be me.

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:38.572
I am Eom, the senior cook.

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:42.701
I cooked His Majesty's food
until you came along.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.329
Oh, I see. Cook Eom.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:48.999
Then…

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:53.420
I am Cook Maeng,
and I am mainly in charge of side dishes.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:58.676
I am Cook Sim.

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:01.887
I manage the fires and the seasonings.

01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:05.766
I prepare

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.017
- the rice--
- All right!

01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:08.853
Now that the introductions are over,

01:09:08.936 --> 01:09:11.647
let's get started on the royal meal.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.694
What is she saying?

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:22.449
His Majesty will be furious
if you don't serve him on time.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:23.826
You know what he's like, right?

01:09:25.119 --> 01:09:26.745
What?

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:28.664
Then what will you do?

01:09:29.248 --> 01:09:33.294
You are the chief royal cook.
Do your duty and instruct us!

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:35.546
How many side dishes and of what kind?

01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:37.047
What meat goes in the soup

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:39.758
- and what cardinal-colored ingredients--
- Oh, come on.

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:41.886
What do I know about the royal kitchen?

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:43.220
I'm just here

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:47.057
because His Majesty plopped me here.

01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:48.475
What in the world is she saying?

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:49.685
Do your usual thing.

01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:53.564
Cook Eom and Cook Maeng
can take care of everything.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.195
Of course,
you two will take full responsibility too.

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:00.279
I'll stay out of it.

01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:03.199
What utter nonsense is this?

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:06.493
Why should we be responsible
when we are not the chief royal cook?

01:10:07.828 --> 01:10:10.456
I already told His Majesty

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:12.666
that I won't be doing anything
for the time being

01:10:14.251 --> 01:10:15.502
and will just observe.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.724
If what she said is true,

01:10:28.807 --> 01:10:30.392
this will be the day I die.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.978
There is no way
His Majesty would allow that.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.439
But she does not seem to be lying.

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:43.280
- Cook Min, sharpen the knives!
- Yes, coming!

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:45.074
Get the meat for the soup!

01:10:45.157 --> 01:10:47.576
- The best quality meat!
- I am on it!

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.494
Hurry.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:52.998
Hurry! Where are the sauces
and pastes we hid?

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:55.417
Miss, that was amazing. Good!

01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:58.087
Well done.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:01.674
I've been through these kinds of things
countless times.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.050
It won't work on me.

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.762
What brings you here, Lady Kim?

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.225
- Will you move it?
- Okay.

01:11:12.726 --> 01:11:13.811
Cook Yeon.

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:17.982
Yes?

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:20.442
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
wishes to see you.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.528
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager?

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.156
Why would she want to see me?

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:38.377
What's with this suffocating atmosphere?

01:11:39.753 --> 01:11:43.424
Are you the gwinyeo
that His Majesty brought to the palace

01:11:43.507 --> 01:11:44.967
and appointed as the chief royal cook?

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.266
I'm not a gwinyeo.

01:11:52.349 --> 01:11:54.977
I just come from a faraway place.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:56.687
I will get straight to the point.

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.647
As His Majesty's grandmother,

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:01.984
I summoned you to check
if your skills are genuine.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.278
Check my skills?

01:12:04.361 --> 01:12:07.948
If you captivated His Majesty's tongue
with some shallow tricks,

01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:10.659
you must pay the price.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:14.872
Jeez, what price
do I have to pay this time?

01:12:15.956 --> 01:12:17.124
Ma'am.

01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:21.170
I mean…

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:23.172
Your Royal Highness.

01:12:23.255 --> 01:12:25.674
What exactly is the price to pay?

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:29.595
If you deceive a king with your tongue,
then you must lose your tongue.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.597
If you deceive a king with your food,

01:12:32.222 --> 01:12:33.057
you must lose an arm.

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:34.725
What?

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:37.811
Well…

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:39.813
How do you plan to check my skills?

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:44.568
I will have you compete
against the senior cooks,

01:12:44.651 --> 01:12:45.486
so prepare yourself.

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:50.032
Are you saying that I have to risk my arm,
which is everything to a cook…

01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:53.160
for this competition?

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:56.288
I see you understood.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.624
If you wish to keep your arm,

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.918
convince me with your cooking.

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:03.629
Yes. That is exactly what you will do.

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:07.383
Why on earth do I have to do such a thing?

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.343
Why?

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:15.224
Get out of this if you can.

01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:17.559
It was you.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:19.269
You set this up, didn't you?

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.688
Cutting off an arm of mine
is nothing to you, huh?

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:24.358
It will not end with just one arm.

01:13:25.859 --> 01:13:27.528
Kang Mok-ju.

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:30.447
I'm in big trouble.

01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:34.410
{\an8}You received a message
from Principal Drafter Yi Jang-gyun

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:35.744
{\an8}of Hongmungwan, Office of Royal Decrees?

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.162
{\an8}Yes, Your Majesty.

01:13:43.877 --> 01:13:45.379
{\an8}I have obtained a draft
of the historical record.

01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:47.131
{\an8}I will meet you tonight
at the twenty-second hour.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.758
{\an8}He found the draft.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:53.720
I will finally be able to find out
the secret behind my mother's death.

01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:57.808
Your Majesty,
it is I, the Chief Royal Secretary.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.272
You may enter.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.242
What is it?

01:14:15.325 --> 01:14:17.995
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
has summoned Cook Yeon.

01:14:18.078 --> 01:14:18.954
What for?

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:23.500
Her Royal Highness
wants to taste the gwinyeo's food.

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:27.254
She is a picky eater
with almost no appetite.

01:14:27.337 --> 01:14:30.674
But she wants to taste her food?

01:14:30.757 --> 01:14:32.759
She is to compete against
the senior cooks,

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:35.137
and Her Royal Highness
demanded that she lose an arm

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:37.431
for deceiving the king
should she lose the competition.

01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:38.599
What? Lose an arm?

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:43.520
What in the world is happening?

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:46.106
I believe Her Grace Consort Kang
was also present.

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:48.233
Consort Kang?

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:09.296
- Everything seems to be ready.
- Yes.

01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:22.309
You may try your best,
but it will be to no avail.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.355
Her Royal Highness
does not care for food at all.

01:15:27.147 --> 01:15:29.441
The only thing she enjoys is…

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:39.409
His Majesty the King has arrived!

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:35.424
I hope you have been well, Grandmother.

01:16:35.507 --> 01:16:36.883
Your Majesty.

01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:40.095
I have not seen you in a long time.

01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:42.472
I heard the gwinyeo
became the chief royal cook,

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:44.558
so I prepared a competition.

01:16:45.058 --> 01:16:46.435
Would you like to watch together?

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:47.644
Yes.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.480
I heard you are holding this competition

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:52.608
for the arm of the gwinyeo
I have appointed.

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:57.404
You seem to care a great deal about her,

01:16:58.905 --> 01:17:03.118
seeing that you came
all the way here to face--

01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:05.912
You are the one
who crossed the line first.

01:17:06.496 --> 01:17:07.831
She is my chief royal cook,

01:17:07.914 --> 01:17:09.374
which means she is my person.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:13.128
All she has to do is win the competition.

01:17:13.211 --> 01:17:15.964
Then all will be well and settled.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:19.176
I heard the ministers objected

01:17:19.259 --> 01:17:21.887
to your appointing her
as the chief royal cook.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:25.891
You must know
their dismay will not die down

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.018
unless something is done.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:29.811
In that case,

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:33.273
will the other cooks
also lose their arms if they lose?

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:38.070
The other cooks have already
been recognized by the palace.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.030
They are not the same.

01:17:40.113 --> 01:17:43.450
Where is the fun in that, Grandmother?

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:46.912
As you said, all they have to do is win.

01:17:47.537 --> 01:17:49.956
It is only right to keep the rules fair.

01:17:53.418 --> 01:17:54.753
Listen carefully.

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:58.006
Other than the one cook who wins today,

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:00.008
the rest will give up an arm.

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:03.845
Do you understand?

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:05.138
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:18:09.142 --> 01:18:10.268
Bring in the straw cutters.

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.585
I really want to go home.

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:37.212
Dad.

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:39.589
I want to go back!

01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:41.675
Very well.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.761
Let the competition begin.

01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:58.775
I have no choice.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.069
All I can do now is prove myself.

01:19:02.779 --> 01:19:04.030
Gwinyeo.

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.366
If it is true
that you came from the future,

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.285
show them

01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:12.330
a new dish that only you can make.

01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:38.774
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:41.943
{\an8}The theme of the competition is…

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:43.737
{\an8}That's cursive.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:45.906
{\an8}Filial piety?

01:19:47.407 --> 01:19:48.992
{\an8}There's no way I'll lose.

01:19:49.075 --> 01:19:50.035
{\an8}Let go!

01:19:52.537 --> 01:19:54.664
{\an8}I heard you were the one
who organized the competition.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:55.957
{\an8}Just let me get something really quick!

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:59.377
{\an8}This is not the time
for you to coddle the gwinyeo.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.505
{\an8}Shut your mouth!

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:04.132
{\an8}There's no flirting or anything going on
between His Majesty and me.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.010
{\an8}- Open your mouth.
- I hope that His Majesty enjoys

01:20:07.093 --> 01:20:08.011
{\an8}your blurting.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:16.812
