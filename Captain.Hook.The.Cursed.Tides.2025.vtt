You have my word, and

- What happened to your hand?

00:28:51.971 --> 00:28:56.458
- Let's just say, things
didn't go according to plan.

00:28:58.322 --> 00:29:01.015
And there's someone coming
for more than just my hand.

00:29:02.395 --> 00:29:03.258
I just need food.

00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:15.201

but you need to leave after.

I don't want any problems.

you need to leave.

They're looking for you.

00:30:31.036 --> 00:30:32.209
And if they find you here,

00:30:32.244 --> 00:30:33.935
I'll probably end
up dead as well.

You lie.

Why are you so loyal

I'll ask you one more time, boy.

If you do not tell
me, I will kill you.

before the English came and
claimed it as their own.

Smee and his men, they
left the island after.

00:41:05.877 --> 00:41:06.878
But my revenge remained.

would like to inform you

00:41:53.269 --> 00:41:55.858
that I strongly
believe that Hook

is residing on the island
of Eldritch Landing.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:02.278
I'm asking for your permission

He can't be far due

what you're talking about.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.745

Wait.

00:45:23.444 --> 00:45:24.238
Wait.

00:45:24.273 --> 00:45:25.274
Wait.

00:45:25.308 --> 00:45:26.275
- [Ymirskald] Where is he?

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:28.415
- [James] Looking for me?

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:30.831
[anvil clanging]

00:45:30.866 --> 00:45:32.039
You big bastard.

[jaunty pensive music continues]

00:46:04.451 --> 00:46:07.281
- [Ymirskald] Where
are you, Hook?

00:46:11.458 --> 00:46:15.531
[jaunty pensive music continues]

00:46:52.568 --> 00:46:55.329

[birds chirping]

00:47:19.491 --> 00:47:21.114
- Wait, what do you mean we?

00:47:23.357 --> 00:47:25.049
- They now know
you're helping me.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.535
So you're as dead as I am
if they get hold of you.

00:47:29.916 --> 00:47:31.089
Sorry, about that.

00:47:37.475 --> 00:47:39.063
- I thought a life of being
hunted down was a thing

00:47:39.097 --> 00:47:42.480
of the past, but I guess
it's all caught up now.

00:47:44.551 --> 00:47:47.209
That's not gonna stop
me from fighting back.

00:47:47.243 --> 00:47:49.625
- Problem is, it's
just the two of us.

00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:50.902
We don't have a crew.

00:47:52.352 --> 00:47:53.629
But Smee must be defeated.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:56.252
He's just not gonna stop.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.331
Hey, wait, wait.

00:48:06.366 --> 00:48:07.194
Silas.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.544
How good are your
hunting skills?

00:48:14.063 --> 00:48:15.513
I've got an idea.

- [Smee] Your majesty.

00:50:23.296 --> 00:50:24.814
I'm pleased to
inform you that Hook

00:50:24.849 --> 00:50:27.403
has been tracked down
to Eldritch Landing.

00:50:27.438 --> 00:50:29.785
It appears that he's
hiding in the woodland.

00:50:31.683 --> 00:50:34.410
I've sent several of my
men to hunt him down,

00:50:34.445 --> 00:50:37.793
and I'm set to return
myself by dawn.

[birds chirping]

00:54:21.568 --> 00:54:23.570
- Even though we took
out most of his men,

00:54:23.605 --> 00:54:25.814
I wish Smee was there
to join them in death.

00:54:28.368 --> 00:54:30.405
- Well, they definitely
won't be telling the story.

00:54:30.439 --> 00:54:32.855
So why don't we
just do that again.

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:33.960
- It will be a waste of time.

00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:39.793
Smee will be getting
stronger with reinforcements.

00:54:39.828 --> 00:54:41.554
It will be impossible
to trap them all.

00:54:43.141 --> 00:54:45.074
- If we can get to the
other side of the island

00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:46.800
before the sun sets,

00:54:46.835 --> 00:54:49.838
there is a settlement
where you can take a boat.

00:54:49.872 --> 00:54:51.840
- I don't care what
kind of boat it is,

00:54:51.874 --> 00:54:55.706
as long as it gets us
far away from here.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.295
I would happily sneak aboard
a trade ship at this point.

00:55:03.783 --> 00:55:05.612
- I won't be coming with you.

00:55:05.647 --> 00:55:06.889
- What?

00:55:06.924 --> 00:55:08.822
- What are are
you talking about?

00:55:08.857 --> 00:55:09.892
- I can't.

00:55:12.585 --> 00:55:13.724
- Silas.

00:55:13.758 --> 00:55:14.587
Silas.

00:55:15.864 --> 00:55:16.899
Look at me.

00:55:18.487 --> 00:55:21.939
You aren't a stupid man,
so don't say stupid things.

00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:26.875
I admire your respect and
knowledge from Nókheenah,

00:55:26.909 --> 00:55:29.843
but Smee is a madman.

00:55:29.878 --> 00:55:30.913
He's not just gonna
leave you behind

00:55:30.948 --> 00:55:32.881
if he manages to capture me.

00:55:32.915 --> 00:55:36.056
This island won't be your home
while he is still breathing.

00:55:37.713 --> 00:55:41.372
At the end of the day, it's
gonna be either you or him.

00:55:45.894 --> 00:55:48.517
The best we can do is
get far away from here.

00:55:48.552 --> 00:55:51.934
I know places who can
help us get a crew.

00:55:51.969 --> 00:55:53.971
We need to increase
our numbers as well.

00:55:56.836 --> 00:55:58.665
And a bloody ship
would be great too.

00:56:00.943 --> 00:56:02.945

[jaunty pensive music]

00:57:24.855 --> 00:57:25.752

00:57:27.651 --> 00:57:28.893
- Oh, most definitely.

00:57:30.067 --> 00:57:32.932
[Smee laughing]

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:36.901

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:40.767
Make ready.

00:57:43.114 --> 00:57:44.564

Hold it.

00:58:08.208 --> 00:58:09.037
Hold.

00:58:09.071 --> 00:58:11.902

[seagulls cawing]

00:59:55.764 --> 00:59:58.387
I'm afraid I'm running out
of ideas how to take on Smee.

01:00:00.148 --> 01:00:02.909
[waves crashing]

01:00:06.464 --> 01:00:09.882
- [Silas] Have you ever heard
about the island's curse?

01:00:09.916 --> 01:00:12.712
- Are you talking about
witchcraft? Voodoo?

01:00:13.886 --> 01:00:16.820
[waves crashing]

01:00:16.854 --> 01:00:17.855
- Maybe.

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:19.270
- Whatever it is,

01:00:19.305 --> 01:00:20.824
I don't believe in
children's fairytales.

01:00:20.858 --> 01:00:22.826
- Okay, but what if
there's something

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.105
out there, you know,
[seagulls cawing]

01:00:26.139 --> 01:00:27.934
that could help us?

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:32.767
[waves crashing]

[jaunty pensive music]

01:00:47.713 --> 01:00:49.853
- In my childhood, we
were told many tales.

01:00:51.026 --> 01:00:53.201
One of them was about
the curse that befall one

01:00:53.235 --> 01:00:54.685
of the earliest settlers

01:00:55.859 --> 01:00:58.206
who vanished amidst
these very woods.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.143
This young man seeking a new
beginning with a yearning

01:01:04.177 --> 01:01:07.077
for the warmth of a
woman by his side,

01:01:07.111 --> 01:01:09.873
he wandered into the
heart of the forest.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:14.774
Lured by an otherworldly spell.

01:01:16.742 --> 01:01:18.019
Their ethereal voices
[aura crackling]

01:01:18.053 --> 01:01:20.987
found himself drawn
closer and closer

01:01:22.299 --> 01:01:23.921
as the man succumbed

01:01:23.956 --> 01:01:25.854
to the irresistible
pull of their song.

01:01:27.062 --> 01:01:29.789
But these women were
not mere enchantresses.

01:01:29.824 --> 01:01:31.757
They were sisters.

01:01:31.791 --> 01:01:34.829
Their hearts torn
apart by jealousy.

01:01:36.002 --> 01:01:39.143
One of the sisters tried
to save the young man,

01:01:39.178 --> 01:01:43.354
but fate had already
sealed his destiny.

01:01:43.389 --> 01:01:44.942
In the darkness
of that deep lake,

01:01:44.977 --> 01:01:46.426
she tried to reach him,

01:01:47.911 --> 01:01:50.534
but the soul of the
man she loved was lost

01:01:50.568 --> 01:01:51.742
in the depths forevermore.

01:01:53.986 --> 01:01:57.334
She mourned for countless days,
but the pain was too much,

01:01:57.368 --> 01:01:59.060
so she turned to darker entities

01:02:00.164 --> 01:02:02.028
and was bound to
have her revenge.

01:02:03.478 --> 01:02:08.000
Although she found her revenge,
the curse was never lifted.

01:02:17.285 --> 01:02:20.012
[waves crashing]

01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:32.956
[apple creaking]

01:02:38.478 --> 01:02:40.791
I think we should
visit that place.

01:02:40.826 --> 01:02:43.794
[waves crashing]

01:02:45.831 --> 01:02:47.936
And you really
believe in all this?

01:02:53.217 --> 01:02:56.945
The young man's heart
is still there waiting

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.189
to be reunited with
his former lover.

01:03:01.398 --> 01:03:03.262
- How is this going to help us?
