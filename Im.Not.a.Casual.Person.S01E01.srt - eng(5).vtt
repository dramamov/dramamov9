00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.280
The prestigious Chinese Venture Capital Summit

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.039
will soon be held at Linsha Lake.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.479
According to reports, Shen Yifan, CEO of Shen Group,

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.840
will also attend the summit.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.800
This 23-year-old investment prodigy

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.479
has gained attention in recent years for his outstanding investment and acquisition deals

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.920
and has become quite notable in the industry.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.039
However, he has never appeared in public before.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.960
What investment philosophy will Shen Yifan,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.680
who is attending the summit for the first time,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.479
present? Let's wait and see.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.840
The return on investment is too low.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
Making a model that costs millions...

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.600
It would be better to reduce the price by 100 per square meter,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.200
which would help the business more.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.440
The biggest factor limiting metaverse development

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.479
is the hardware.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.520
Even with 8K resolution, VR headsets

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.600
still can't match reality.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.720
Well said.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.040
Mr. Shen, didn't you promise me

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.170
that you would come?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.940
Where exactly are you now?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.480
At the boarding gate.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.720
Mr. Shen, are you at the airport?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.040
Hello?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.680
I am Xiao Chu.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.610
Thank you for saving my life, miss.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.320
May I ask your name?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.400
I stand by who I am.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.920
I am

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.280
Who dares

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.200
to disturb my sweet dreams?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.200
Zheng Ying, you little bastard,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.860
open the door or I'll kill you!

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.160
His name is Yu Youyi.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.800
He's my agent.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.040
Didn't you say you have an important audition today?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.520
Why do you have puffy eyes from oversleeping again?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.800
And I'm someone who dreams of being a hero,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.060
but in reality can only be meek and timid.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.040
A D-list actress.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.160
Eating all day long.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.440
And drinking too.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.720
This is my daily life:

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.960
reading novels and eating snacks,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.600
and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.800
getting scolded by my demon agent.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.839
Youyi,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.200
I'm an artist,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.360
not some immortal,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.760
how can I not eat or drink?

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.760
Don't you agree?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.520
Other actresses work so hard,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.650
why are you so content being a slacker?

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.360
You need to step up your game.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.520
Because she's a gentle and lovely

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.780
elegant lady who enjoys a peaceful life.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.880
Mr. Shen.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.120
Why did you leave me behind and return to China?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.960
To save costs.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.640
I could have paid my own way.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.720
Time costs.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.600
But I'm worried about you going back alone.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.120
I'm already on my way back.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.450
I'll return after I finish one last thing.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.000
Hello, Mr. Photographer.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.400
Hello.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.120
Hello, sir.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.560
Hi.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.540
Hello, sir.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.880
Thank you for your hard work.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.800
Okay.

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.200
You don't need to smile like that with me.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.800
I don't want to smile either,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.240
but my face is frozen.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.610
Did you memorize your lines today?

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.640
There are no small roles, only small actors.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.320
Characters have life.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.240
You need to enter the character's life,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.900
feel the character's soul and resonate with it.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.100
Only then can you portray a beautiful woman with depth.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.640
Brother,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.880
in this show,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.650
I only have three scenes total.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.120
One seducing the eldest young master,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.600
one seducing the second young master,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.330
and one seducing the youngest.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.440
And I only have one line:

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.220
'Young master, do you think I'm pretty?'

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.680
Tell me, where's the soul in that?

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.970
You still need to put your heart into figuring it out.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.280
Brother,

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.600
do you think I can only play these kinds of roles?

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.920
Can't I try other types of roles?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.840
Other types?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.159
With those skinny arms and legs of yours,

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.760
you want to do action scenes?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.400
How do you know it won't work if I haven't tried?

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.400
Mr. Shen,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.800
please get out of the car.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.720
Today you'll know exactly why you're dying.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.240
Do you know who we are?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.280
People who would do this kind of thing

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.010
probably wouldn't reveal their names so easily.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.320
Now, the main content of this scene

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.200
is you being rejected by the rich young master,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.240
B01 running away heartbroken. Memory card

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.600
B010 C027 recording.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.200
It doesn't matter if you're actually heartbroken or not,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.200
just make sure you run beautifully.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.960
Let's start shooting when the actors are ready.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.680
Okay.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.240
The actors are ready.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.400
Action!

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.090
Just keep running until you get back to the hotel.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.400
Mr. Liu sent you here, didn't he?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.330
How did you know?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.420
I've already explained about the withdrawal of funds.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.400
He wants to make dirty money.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.240
And is trying to deceive me for a new round of investment.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.040
It's absolutely preposterous.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.960
I'm in a hurry.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.650
Take me to where I need to go.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.740
How much is Mr. Liu paying you?

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.330
I'll pay double.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.080
Triple.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.200
Our boss said.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.400
The losses caused by your withdrawal of funds

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.480
can't be measured in money.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.240
Ten times.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.000
Even ten times isn't enough.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.720
Kidnapping and extortion.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.400
That's quite bold.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.360
Hello?

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920
Is this 110?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.520
There's been a kidnapping here.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.600
Now

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.850
I've tied up the kidnapper.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.680
This is Luoxi Manor,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.960
the filming location of 'Arrogant Young Master Falls for Me'.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.480
You all

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.080
Zheng Ying

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.080
Zheng Ying

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.200
Oh no.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.810
She's also surnamed Zheng.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.370
Just like the heroine I'm looking for.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.620
Durian-flavored dried sweet potatoes.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.680
What a weird flavor.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.290
Come on, let's clean up.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.520
We're done for today.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.650
I don't care what method you use today.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.360
Fine.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.360
I don't want to hear your excuses.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.920
If you don't bring him here today,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.200
you can just stay at his place.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.060
Did you hear me?

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.720
How do I look today?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.560
Do I fit the role I'm auditioning for?

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.160
Listen to me.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600
This opportunity

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.680
took me ages to get from the director.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.640
The director has seen your profile.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.720
Your look is fine.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.240
It's your acting skills.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.520
I practically begged the director.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.800
You must make the most of this chance.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.560
Got it?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.400
Yes, I got it.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.640
I've poured my heart out so many times.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.960
Hurry!

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.920
Quick!

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.820
Mr. Shen, you're here.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.240
Take it easy.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.980
Please come in.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.640
Hurry up!

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.120
Thank you for coming, Mr. Shen.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.480
You've suddenly returned from abroad.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.640
Without any notice.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.760
We could have picked you up at the airport.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.720
I provided the funding.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.840
That's why the platform trusted you with the S+ project.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.100
Yet you leaked my personal information.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.320
Is this how you repay me?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.240
No, I...

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.080
I didn't do it.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.840
Bye-bye.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.600
I'm sorry. The company has important guests today.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.860
Everyone else, please use the back door.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.240
In 3 minutes,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.880
I want to see this year's financial report.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.000
This...

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.080
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.800
No problem, Mr. Shen.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.160
It's just... Mr. Shen...

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.560
I just remembered we have another meeting.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.560
Would you mind waiting here for a moment?

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.040
I'm only giving you 10 minutes.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.160
10 minutes...

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.120
Yes, Mr. Shen.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.560
Hurry up! We only have 10 minutes.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.690
I told you to prepare it in advance.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.560
Is the audition here?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.700
Why isn't anyone here?

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.800
This show must not be popular.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.520
The male actor says,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.720
'Why hasn't your boss arrived yet?'

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.320
Why hasn't your boss shown up yet?

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.040
This is completely wasting my time.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.640
He must be another actor here for the audition.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.600
Perfect. We can rehearse together.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.920
The boss isn't here.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.880
I'm here to keep you company.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.800
It's you.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.200
That's right.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.620
I'm the executive assistant.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.730
Little Sweetie.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.760
Isn't that Zheng Ying?

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.980
What is she doing here?

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.040
Here, you need to... quick!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.200
Quick... what?

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.080
Don't go.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.810
I came all the way back from Switzerland just for you.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.920
What exactly do you want?

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.040
Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.040
This...

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.680
This...

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.280
This button.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.360
Forget the button. Get out of my way.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.840
It's okay.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.120
About this little seduction scene...

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.400
I also designed a move

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.960
where I can pull the tie.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.920
Like this.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.200
Let me go.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.640
Or maybe I'll undo this button too.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.360
Excuse me, where do I line up for the audition?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.760
Has it started yet?

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.440
You're on the wrong floor. It's one floor down.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.700
It's already started.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.000
Thanks.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.520
So the audition is on the floor below.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.410
Let's hurry down there.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160
I'll go ahead first.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.490
See you at the audition.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.680
I wonder if I'll still get to act with you later.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.140
I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.840
What terrible taste this person has.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.770
How can anyone swallow this stuff?

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.540
Have you heard?

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.180
Young Master Shen is here.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.240
Could it be that legendary investment tycoon?

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.240
Shen Yifan?

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:13.930
Mr. Shen.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.320
Our Black and White Entertainment's profit this year

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.840
can exceed 160 percent.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.560
160 percent?

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.960
Your profits must have fallen from the sky.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.100
This number is quite auspicious though.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.660
Let's set it as your company's profit target for this year.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.740
How about that?

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.140
Can you achieve it?

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.020
You really think you can do it?

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.760
Don't think that because I'm abroad,

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.160
I don't know about the current winter in the film industry

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.000
and how difficult things really are.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.660
If you can't do it, just say so.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.340
You hold a large amount of quality intellectual property.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.490
As long as you stay grounded

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.620
and focus on solid creative work,

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.800
you'll definitely produce projects that audiences love.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.130
I do pursue efficiency,

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.080
but I also respect established facts

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.400
and industry patterns.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.240
Yes.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.560
Mr. Shen is right.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.880
Mr. Shen's words are excellent.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.640
We'll definitely work hard.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.680
He's really handsome.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.640
Look, I just took a sneaky photo.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.839
So handsome!

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.520
This perfect jawline.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.200
It's amazing.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.119
So handsome.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Looking like a magpie. What's handsome about that?

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.760
Could he be...

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.120
He came back from Switzerland just to find you.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.020
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.880
This... this button.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.720
I don't want the button anymore.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.200
It can't be such a coincidence.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.200
Shen Yifan

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.880
He's not a CEO, but he creates many CEOs.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.360
If he wants to promote you,

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.720
even if you're just a piece of glass,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.880
he can turn you into a diamond.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.920
If he wants to crush you,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.320
even if you're a diamond,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.600
you'll be reduced to shattered glass.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.960
However, Mr. Shen,

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.320
to be honest,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.960
the company's performance this year

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.920
isn't very good.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.240
Besides the industry climate,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.240
the main reason

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.640
is that Cheng Corporation's 'One Screen Sunshine'

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.700
has taken too many resources from us.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.160
Mr. Shen, you have no idea,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.520
they're so domineering.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.240
Let me tell you,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.760
as long as companies like theirs exist...

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.360
Mr. Liang,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.740
remember this:

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.520
Any project backed by Shen Group

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.420
can achieve anything.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.000
Yes, yes, yes.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.440
Right.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.760
I'm done for.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.280
He really is an investor.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.200
How can an investor be more handsome than an actor?

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.400
I'm totally dead now.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.440
Mr. Liang.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.640
That girl,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.080
do you have her information?

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.980
The girl you just asked about,

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.360
she came to our company today for an interview.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360
She's an actress.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.960
Her name is

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.880
Zheng Ying.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.370
By the way, Mr. Shen,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.880
the actresses we select

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.800
are all completely natural.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.680
Beautiful since childhood.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.120
Rest assured.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.600
It's her.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.320
It really is her.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.760
What's with his eyes

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.290
looking at me like I'm prey?

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.080
Stay calm.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.800
Maybe it's nothing.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.320
Long time no see,

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.210
Zheng Xiaohong.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.400
How do you even know my former name?

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.560
Seems like you're not letting me off the hook.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.880
Mr. Shen,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.720
what can I do for you?

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.240
Zheng Xiaohong, 25 years old,

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.720
Sagittarius.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.800
Oh my god,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.600
how did you dig up all my background?

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.520
Chenyang No. 2 Elementary School.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.000
I just pulled off two of his buttons.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.440
Does he have to hold such a grudge?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.770
Lives on Xingfu Street.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.040
Wanli Neighborhood.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.120
I hope I'm not going to be shelved. 36th floor,

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:31.800
right?

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.920
Oh my god,

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.690
this is terrifying.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.490
I need to eat a rainbow candy to calm my nerves.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.370
Why are you here?

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.460
Young Mr. Shen,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.320
when your father heard about your kidnapping,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.400
he was furious.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.440
So he sent me to come quickly

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.850
to stay with you.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.040
You treated him like a supporting actor

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.370
and even had him help you with your scenes.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.370
But not only did he act with you,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.860
you also got him...

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.520
You just texted me

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.120
saying you found her so quickly.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.720
Congratulations, Mr. Shen.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.000
What should we do next?

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.440
The thing is, he asked me to go over,

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.400
like some kind of Aladdin's lamp,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.840
asking what my wish was.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.850
Isn't that strange?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.560
What does he really want?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.560
She's been an actress for five years

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.480
without a single memorable role.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.160
Right now,

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.540
she definitely wants a good role.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800
I get it.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.970
He must want to sleep with me for a role.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.010
That's impossible.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.540
Have you forgotten about that incident?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.360
Here, have some water.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.560
Thank you, Director.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.120
If you come with me,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.850
you can choose any role in the film.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.800
I can make it happen for you.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.480
Director,

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.360
are you trying to sleep with me for a role?

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.560
You could say that.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.600
See this? I'm recording.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.060
You can keep your 'luck' to yourself.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.160
That sleazy Director Wang

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.880
can't compare to Shen Yifan.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.080
Sleep with you?

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.890
Why would he need to do that?

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.080
As long as I can get her a good role,

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.420
it should count as helping her fulfill her wish.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.200
So the first rule of the casting couch

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.680
is promising resources.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.240
Who do you think you're looking down on?

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.770
I'm not that kind of person.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.360
Watch your attitude.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.800
Director Wang is just a small-time director in the industry.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.800
But Shen Yifan

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.680
is a big shot in the investment circle.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.840
If you offend Director Wang,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.400
you'll just be without work for half a year at most.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.160
But if you offend Shen Yifan,

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.840
you'll be blacklisted.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.400
I

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.610
still prefer shooting campus dramas.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.640
This is a workplace drama, so...

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.540
This is a campus drama.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.560
Actually, I

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.560
quite enjoy filming period dramas.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.240
These are all period dramas.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.200
Take your pick.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.800
I'm always in period dramas,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.170
but I should try something different.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.120
Mystery.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.000
Sci-fi.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:21.880
Fantasy.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.410
Romance.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.860
Whatever you like.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.960
Do you have something

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200
that's not quite sci-fi,

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.400
but has some mystery,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.600
fantasy with workplace elements,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.160
workplace with some romance,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.090
and romance with a touch of comedy?

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.200
It's such a shame.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.200
That's exactly what I want to act in.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.360
Mr. Shen,

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.960
I appreciate your kindness,

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.160
but it's really unfortunate.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.560
If there's nothing else, I'll be going now.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.640
Mr. Shen.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.000
Since she doesn't want it,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.280
why don't we just go home?

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.240
You can go home.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.250
I was looking to replace my assistant anyway.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.440
Aren't you hungry eating so little?

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440
I heard we need to rush the shooting today.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.680
We'll be filming until late,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.840
so there might not be any midnight snacks.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.040
It's fine. I'm not hungry. I'm on a diet.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.880
Hey there.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.520
Want some snacks?

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.440
Durian-flavored chips.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.880
If you don't like durian,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.760
I also have chili pepper flavor,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.730
and black garlic flavor to try.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.320
No, thanks.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.400
I don't have such strong taste preferences yet.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.880
Life is about being brave enough to try new things,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.600
that's how you discover pleasant surprises.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.760
These are all made by

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.880
a friend of mine.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.140
She made them herself.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.090
They're low-fat. You definitely won't gain much weight eating these.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.600
Mr. Shen

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.820
please take a look at this.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.480
So she doesn't want to get a good role.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.090
She wants to earn money with her own hands.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.840
No wonder she rejected so many projects.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.440
So,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.120
what should we do next?

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.050
Give a man a fish,

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.410
and you feed him for a day. Teach him to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.330
Are you Miss Zheng Ying?

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.160
Hello.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.760
We're from Juhao Snack Shop.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.160
We saw you're selling snacks and we're very interested.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.760
We'd like to cooperate with you.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.640
If you agree,

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.040
Is this for real? This snack factory?

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.080
it's all yours.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.560
Great!

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.820
She finally accepted.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.160
Our mission is accomplished.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.400
We can go home soon.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.600
Which of my snacks caught your interest?

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.000
Fried coriander crisps.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.840
I'm allergic to coriander,

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.280
so I've never made that.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.410
He sent you here, didn't he?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.800
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.680
It's my fault for not investigating properly.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.360
I've seen people giving clothes, bags, gifts,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.320
even leasing fish ponds.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.520
But offering a business license is a first for me.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.650
I thought he'd lose interest quickly,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.240
but I didn't expect him to be so persistent.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.760
This isn't persistence.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.320
This is harassment.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.960
What will he do next?

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.800
Will he bother my family?

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.320
Should I contact her family?

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.600
No.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.760
Better not disturb them.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.920
I should find out what she needs first.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.840
Mr. Shen,

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.320
please don't rush. Let's take it slow.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.480
Take it slow?

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.080
Do you think I have time for that?

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.290
So what do you want to do?

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.560
I want to teach him a good lesson.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.480
And tell him

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.160
I'm not someone to be messed with.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.920
Good idea.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.420
But I advise you not to think that way.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.040
What else?

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.530
Then there's only one option left.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:26.920
Brother,

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.000
I want to join the film crew.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.130
Whatever role it is,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.160
I'll join the cast immediately.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.050
Just tell me.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.080
Fine. Your ejection fraction is only 40%.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.360
So

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.880
how much time do I have left?

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.760
If you don't have surgery,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.640
your condition could deteriorate suddenly

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.760
and might be life-threatening.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.240
But surgery comes with risks too.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.570
I promised my brother I'd have the surgery

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.730
on condition that he gives me six months to return home and fulfill my wish.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.160
And my wish was to find you.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.080
Zheng Xiaohong.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.920
That person looks like a magpie

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.120
but acts like a crow.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.940
[Japanese character]

[Chinese character]

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.280
Long time no see.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.170
Zheng Xiaohong.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.960
Zheng Xiaohong.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.840
25 years old,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.240

Is that right?

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.700
This character is a bit weird.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.920
Can you handle it?

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.800
It's fine. Didn't you say

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.840
actors shouldn't be picky about roles?

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.480
Besides,

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.920
I just need to avoid him now.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.090
Let's go.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.800
What?

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.920
She ran away.
