Brother Youyi,

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.600
you're building me up just to let me down.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.880
This group looks good.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.520
Who are the main actors?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.120
They have quite a following.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.479
I forgot to tell you.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.520
The female lead in this show

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.250
is Chen Qing.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.820
Brother Youyi,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.570
are you messing with me?

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.080
How could I?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.120
She just stole your boyfriend, that's all.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.520
So you won't act with her?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.120
Can't you show some professional integrity as an actress?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.920
Still eating?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.560
I can act with her.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040
As long as I don't see you-know-who.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.240
I forgot to tell you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.440
the male lead in this show

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.079
is that guy.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.800
Ugh!

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.240
What kind of world is this?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.240
He even managed to get the lead role.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.120
Wait a minute.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.760
My ex-boyfriend is the male lead,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.440
that homewrecker is the female lead,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.280
and you want me to play the supporting role for them?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.320
Yu Youyi,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.520
and you still claim you're not messing with me?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.440
Alright, alright.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.520
Learn from your big brother here.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.880
Be flexible.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.880
Don't cause trouble.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.080
I'll make it up to you.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.800
Yu Youyi.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.680
Mr. Shen.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.120
We followed her all the way to the film set to help her.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.450
Is it really necessary?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.210
The information in her profile

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.480
is visible to us.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.079
Which means

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.160
there's a lot more I can't see.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.600
When we don't have equal access to information,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.640
we shouldn't act rashly on our own.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.880
We need to wait for her to reveal

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.140
what she really wants.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.020
What I need to accomplish,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.380
I will definitely achieve it.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.840
Xiaoying.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.960
Don't you recognize me?

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.040
I must have been blind

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.120
to ever know you.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.360
How could I forget?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.680
Xiaoying!

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.210
Long time no see.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.400
Still so mischievous.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.220
I'm not just mischievous,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.560
I want to skin you alive.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.040
Xiaoying,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.380
don't be like this.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.880
We're still good friends, right?

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.560
They say dogs are man's best friends,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.080
but I wonder if a scumbag counts as a dog.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.240
Zheng Ying.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.760
You've been broken up for so long,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.090
yet you still can't get over our Gong Jing.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.600
Take a good look at yourself.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.460
Are you worthy?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.080
You two are the perfect match in the world.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.000
You need to lock it down.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.280
I'm the one who got you this role.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.420
Be careful or I'll have you kicked off this production.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.680
Whatever your intentions are,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.760
I will finish filming properly.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.100
Have you

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.160
talked to the front desk?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.560
Your room is at the far end.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.480
It's a suite.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.240
Which floor are the actors staying on?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.240
The lead actors are in the suite next door.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.320
The other main cast

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.280
are on the 7th and 8th floors in the inner rooms.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.410
It's quieter there.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.700
What about her?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.480
Yu Youyi.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.159
So this is the great job you arranged for me.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.159
Hello.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.650
Are you Miss Zheng Ying?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.000
Please.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.560
You...

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.240
Are you sure?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.680
Absolutely certain.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.680
Did the production team approve this?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.560
I hope I won't end up

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.040
paying for this myself.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240
Please don't worry.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.720
This is the hotel's compensation

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.040
for the improper room arrangement.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040
It has nothing to do with the production team.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.160
Enjoy your stay.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.480
You too.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.210
Well played, Chen Qing.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.100
No wonder they asked me to play this role.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.400
Very well.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.720
You've successfully fired up my fighting spirit.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.640
She rejected the role we offered her before.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.240
She refused the factory too.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.770
Mr. Shen.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.120
Your wisdom in

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.080
adjusting the strategy timely is impressive.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.840
By helping her secretly like this,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.370
she's finally accepted it.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.720
So now,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.440
does this mean our plan is complete

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440
and we can go home?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.650
Whatever your intentions are,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.800
I'll finish filming properly.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.920
No.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.170
I need to continue supporting her.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.320
At the very least,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.480
I want to ensure she completes this film smoothly.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.040
Sir,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320
try some of these.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.360
Thank you. It's nothing.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.640
Director,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280
please try these.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.800
I made them myself.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.520
Really?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.760
They're delicious.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.480
Alright.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.800
Try some.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.880
Thanks.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.280
How pathetic.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.000
Everyone!

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.720
Ms. Chen Qing is treating everyone to macarons.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.180
Please come and get yours.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.040
Great.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.680
There's one for everyone.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.480
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.200
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.760
Things that don't belong to you,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.520
you can admire them privately,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.200
but don't actually think you deserve them.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.520
Take it.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.740
Whatever you get to eat

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.260
is only because I allow it.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.760
Chen Qing's uncle is Xu Zhiyou,

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.640
the owner of Dashanren Media

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.650
and the main investor of this show.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.280
If Zheng Ying wants to finish filming smoothly,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.920
she'll have to put up with it.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.140
While I'm here,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.880
she doesn't need to tolerate anything.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.640
Oh, how did it accidentally fall on the floor

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.960
and become trash?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.360
You.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.960
Oh, right.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.400
Ms. Chen seems to love picking up trash.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.920
Why don't you pick it up

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.050
and enjoy it slowly?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.400
Hello?

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.080
Mr. Du,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.280
our boss Shen

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.640
wants you to deliver 100 sets of skincare products to the film crew.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.840
In Zheng Ying's name.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.640
Remember,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.300
it's in Zheng Ying's name.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.480
Let's go.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.320
This couldn't be Shen Yifan's car, could it?

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.480
[Quiet on set]

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.880
He wouldn't follow me here, would he?

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.360
Senior.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.360
Hello, senior.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.480
My name is Wan Yuchen.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.800
I'm 22 years old.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.610
I'm currently studying at Nanying Film Academy.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.320
Anyway,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.580
I hope you'll look after me in the future.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.000
He's really

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.880
handsome and polite.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.090
You too, senior.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.900
You're gentle and beautiful.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.560
What brings you here?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.720
I heard you gave everyone in the team a set of implants.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.880
I came to thank you.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.080
Hello?

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.960
I came to visit you on set.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.040
I'm in your room now.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.200
Brother, you could have just come,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.160
but why did you actually give everyone in our crew

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.760
a set of skincare products?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.200
And under my name too.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:12.680
No.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.420
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't afford it.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.760
Then who could it be?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.760
Could it be...

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.850
Could it possibly be...

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.720
Shen Yifan?

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.360
I must be seeing things.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.320
How could I possibly see him here?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.000
First he changed your room,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.240
then used your name

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.170
to send all those gifts to the crew.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.560
What is he trying to do?

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.600
You know what,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.280
his approach of quietly contributing

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.200
is actually more touching than his domineering tactics

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.260
from the other day.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.320
So you're touched?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.720
I wouldn't dare be moved.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.360
I haven't even touched the skincare products.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.880
Shen Yifan, oh Shen Yifan.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.560
We've only met a few times.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.360
Do you really need to like me that much?

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.480
It's so frustrating.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.480
Why don't we just run away?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.040
We have experience with that anyway.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.880
No, no.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.320
He chases, I flee.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.520
I can't escape even if I grew wings.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.720
Can you be serious?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.160
This is no time for jokes.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.600
What I mean is,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.660
running away isn't the solution.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.480
Based on our current situation,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.680
we can only face the challenge head-on.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.320
Miss Zheng, are you here today

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.440
to reject me again?

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.600
Although rejecting someone

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.560
as excellent and perfect as you breaks my heart,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.480
I must.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.760
But Mr. Shen,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.000
one shouldn't accept rewards they haven't earned.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.960
So I'm sorry,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.730
I can't accept this.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.840
I refuse to play by those unspoken rules,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.570
no matter how handsome you are.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.600
These things

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.120
are indeed a bit embarrassing to offer.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.880
Miss Zheng,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.080
if you have any concerns,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.700
you can tell me in advance.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.160
We can completely avoid

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.820
these unnecessary troubles.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.560
How much clearer do I need to be?

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.600
You're

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.600
a high and mighty boss,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.440
and I'm just a struggling small-time actress.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.640
The two of us

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.560
simply don't belong in the same world.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.620
Do you understand?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.520
Indeed,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.640
between the two of us,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
we truly aren't from the same world.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.880
But between us,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.810
there was once a small connection.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.040
So you can certainly accept my gesture.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.530
Because what you did

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.330
completely deserves all this.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.680
I went there to reject him!

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.280
Why is it that when I see his face...

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.800
It must be because after Gong Jing cheated on me,

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.730
I started to doubt myself a little,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.420
feeling I wasn't good enough.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.880
After what he said to me today,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.760
I'm actually quite touched.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.760
Before,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.060
you rejected him over and over again.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.560
It can't be just because of this.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.600
And before that,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.560
you hit him when you were acting together.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.000
He's not a masochist.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.560
And even before that,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.160
you...

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.440
I get it.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.360
I knew there was something familiar about him.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.200
I always thought

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.560
he was just an investor who liked what he saw.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.240
But actually,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.480
he's a pure-hearted boy who was saved by my beauty

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.000
and now wants to repay the favor.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440
That's possible.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.880
What 'beauty saving a hero'?

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.740
How come I never heard about this?

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.900
Why does she always reject me?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.010
But it doesn't matter anymore.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.480
What I need to ensure now

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.080
is that she finishes filming this movie smoothly.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.010
Everything else

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.080
has nothing to do with me.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.080
Stop!

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.640
Look, Zheng Ying,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.560
can you stop acting so affected?

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.680
The way you're swaying,

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.080
everyone around wants to punch you.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.280
I'm sorry, director.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.680
I'll do better.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.280
Stop!

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.400
Stop!

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.080
Stop!

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.360
Gong Jing, what are you laughing at?

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.160
I'll punch you if you don't stop.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.640
Stop!

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.210
What are you acting?

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.680
Director.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.440
Let's do this.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.770
I'll rehearse with her.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.200
Give us some time, okay?

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.480
Fine. Make it quick.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.400
Xiaoying, it hurts, Xiaoying.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.880
I'm warning you.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.600
Don't call me Xiaoying again.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.920
Alright, Xiaoying.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.160
Be gentle, please.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.960
Don't play the victim with me.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.160
You think I still care about you?

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.420
Let me tell you, Gong Jing.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.320
Just focus on acting from now on.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.600
If you ever look at me again

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.160
with those sneaky eyes of yours,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.320
I'll poke them out.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.840
Even after breaking up, you're still trying to hook up with him.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.560
I think you're taking your supporting role way too seriously.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.220
Zheng Ying.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.800
I thought

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.200
she came to learn acting skills from me.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.480
I didn't expect this.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.160
You know,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.800
when it comes to acting,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.200
she's always admired me.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.400
My acting is poor.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.020
But my temper is worse.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.060
Want to test it?

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.080
I find you two quite amusing every day.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.920
Putting on a little soap opera for me, aren't you?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.560
Chen Qing.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.280
You're just relying on your uncle

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.760
to act all high and mighty every day.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.960
What's so great about that?

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.560
I can get those roles because of my uncle.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.760
My family background is my talent, so what?

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.400
Darling, let's go.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.000
Mr. Shen

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.200
Are you okay?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.840
Ask the crew how much this costs.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.620
Send the bill to her agent.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.440
It's such a small matter.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.160
No need to trouble my agent.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.040
I'll pay for it myself.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.640
I forgot my phone.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.800
How embarrassing.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.530
What's this?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.360
Dried durian.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:17:59.960
Is it good?

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.520
It's delicious. Really good.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.450
I made it myself.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.720
Try some.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.140
Then let's use this as compensation.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.280
You said it yourself.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.240
A promise is a promise.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.560
I'll painfully part with this snack as compensation.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.160
About the board I kicked and damaged,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.800
please don't tell my agent.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.580
I'll be forever grateful for your kindness.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.210
Go negotiate with the crew.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.260
Young Mr. Shen,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.400
this snack from Zheng Ying

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.860
doesn't look quite right.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.840
Mr. Shen Senior told you not to eat random food.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:45.810
It's not bad.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.800
What kind of lousy production is this?

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.400
Not a single normal person here.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.260
Let me tell you,

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.320
the male lead is so effeminate.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.920
And this female lead throws tantrums all the time,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.760
like she's some royal concubine making a grand exit.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.680
The worst of all

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.200
is that second female lead.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.400
Yes, Zheng Ying.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.760
No idea what her background is.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.160
Looks-wise, she's a 9 out of 10.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.800
Her IQ seems to be above 90 too.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.800
But she just can't memorize

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.520
a single line with more than nine words.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.680
However,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.560
she does have one strength.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.200
Consistency.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.080
I mean,

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.240
in seduction scenes, she's completely expressionless.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.320
In romantic scenes, expressionless.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.800
In scheming scenes,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.680
still expressionless.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.440
And I, with my professional training,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.900
have to put on a brave face with her every day.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.540
I'm just so done with this.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.960
I have something to do. Let's talk later.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.000
Hello,

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.040
senior.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.240
When did you get here?

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.760
Since you said

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.240
that the second female lead was the most troublesome.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.240
Well,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560
look, senior.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.320
You have a full forehead,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.640
prominent nose bridge but not excessively so.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.300
This is definitely the face of someone blessed with good fortune.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.880
You just said more than nine words,

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.000
so I can't remember all that.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.120
Senior.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.240
You appear so peaceful in public,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.840
but behind the scenes, you're trying to stab others in the back.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.370
That really leaves quite an impression on me.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.170
I'll reluctantly compensate you for the snacks,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.200
but about the board I kicked and broke,

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.200
please don't tell my agent about it.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.740
I'll be forever grateful for your kindness.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840
Set gossip,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040
51 items,

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.260
guaranteed fresh.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.680
What are you trying to do?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.640
What I want to do

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.040
depends on what you want to do, senior.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.480
If you don't want to do anything,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.000
then I don't want to do anything either.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.240
Let's not do anything

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.200
and work together for a peaceful and harmonious film set.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.420
How about that?

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.560
That's exactly what I was thinking.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.490
Then it's a deal.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:04.880
Mr. Shen.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.050
Don't you think this film crew is quite interesting?

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.540
You can't buy unusual snacks.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.400
Why don't you try normal ones?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160
Keep trying.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.320
Director.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.120
These new script changes...

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.400
Aren't they a bit ridiculous?

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.250
Did the screenwriter make these changes?

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.400
Xiaoying.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.480
I understand.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.880
This screenwriter...

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.200
Has taken all the negative traits

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.640
that people can and cannot imagine

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.770
and written them into your character.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.600
If nothing unexpected happens,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.920
once this show airs,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.640
I'll be drowned in viewers' criticism

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.320
because of this extremely bizarre character.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.440
I don't want to portray you like this either,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.570
but what can I do when her uncle is rich?

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.140
What's wrong, Zheng Ying?

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.240
We are all professional actors here.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.300
How can you complain about your role?

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.240
Is this really necessary for the character?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.240
Chen Qing, aren't you going too far?

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.480
Besides, how can actors change the script as they please?

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480
Well, I can.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.720
Let me tell you something.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.920
I can not only change the script,

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.320
but I can also cut scenes.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.320
Director.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.760
I've changed my mind.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.920
I want all her scenes deleted.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.560
I want her to leave right now,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.820
get out of this production immediately.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.440
I think

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.220
the one who should get out of this crew

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.200
is you.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.720
Why are you here?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.130
If I didn't come,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.460
wouldn't you be bullied to death?

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.120
Director,

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.820
continue shooting

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.700
with the original script.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.800
Mr. Shen, this is my own business.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.660
Young Mr. Shen.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.200
You don't seem to understand.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.600
Changing the script

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.600
is something only investors can do.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.600
How much did Chen Qing's uncle invest?

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.600
About one-third.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.250
Find an opportunity

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.120
to establish a connection with Xu Zhiyou.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:12.760
Mr. Shen,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.640
what do you want with him?

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.320
He bullied my people,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.160
interfered with my business,

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.960
so of course I need to have a talk with him.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.890
Talk about life,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.260
talk about dreams.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.860
The current investor of this show

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.920
is me.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.720
Mr. Shen.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.400
Don't think you can do whatever you want just because you invested some money.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.860
Your attitude toward me isn't appropriate.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.340
Don't you want to work with my uncle anymore?

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.720
You can call your uncle

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.340
and ask him.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.400
If I treat his niece with this attitude,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.450
would he still want to work with me?

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.880
So handsome!

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.280
Is this a knight in shining armor scene?

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.600
No wonder Zheng Ying gets such good treatment on set.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.560
Fresh gossip coming soon, guaranteed juicy.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.520
80.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.090
Shen Yifan, let go of me.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.440
You're angry.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.280
What else?

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.040
I told you not to say anything,

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.570
so why did you still do that?

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.340
If I hadn't helped you,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.000
you would've been kicked out of the production by now, you know that?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.400
I don't need your help.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.280
Besides, what's the worst that could happen?

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.810
I'd just leave, that's all.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.960
Do you really care so little about your career?

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.000
I do care,

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.680
but that's my business,

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.610
what does it have to do with you?

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.760
Asking for my help now

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.080
is your best option.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.720
Zheng Ying, let me tell you,

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.360
capable

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.000
and insightful people

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.440
know how to utilize all resources around them.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.960
They know how to maximize the benefits of resources

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.160
and achieve their greatest potential.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.000
Shen Yifan, let me tell you something too.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.200
I don't need you meddling in my affairs,

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.930
and I don't want any involvement with you.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.680
I was just playing a villain role,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.000
and I was fine with that.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.880
But now?

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.400
Everyone thinks I'm just riding on someone's coattails.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.400
Is this the result you wanted to see?

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.840
Are you trying to ruin me?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.800
Of course not.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.920
I just want what's best for you.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.880
Then please take back your kindness

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.480
and stop interfering in other people's lives on your own accord.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.540
If I hadn't helped you,

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.240
you would've been kicked out of the crew by now, you know that?

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.800
But that's my own business.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.650
What does it have to do with you?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.760
Was I being too harsh?

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.600
But now,

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.200
everyone thinks I'm just riding on your coattails.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.860
Is this what you wanted to see?

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.600
Are you trying to ruin me?

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.000
Ungrateful.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.840
Busybody.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.400
Senior.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.570
What's going on?

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.480
It's all because of our female lead from Gray Love,

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.280
the all-powerful Chen Qing.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.480
She insisted the director organize this fan visit day

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.240
and invited a bunch of media.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.400
I bet she's planning a livestream

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.080
to promote our project in advance.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.080
She doesn't show up for major scenes or important shots.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.400
Today the male lead isn't even here,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.200
and it's just scenes with her and me.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.320
What kind of promotion is this?

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.040
What's the point of this visit?

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.570
Let's go.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.640
Isn't this the person who bullied our sister?

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.240
With us here,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.560
no one can bully our Qingqing.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.220
That's her.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.500
Aren't you scared?

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.640
Their looks could kill.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.680
What's there to be afraid of?

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.210
If looks could really kill,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.970
then all my years of martial arts training would be for nothing.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.240
Mr. Shen.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.680
She's so ungrateful,

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.360
why should we help her anymore?

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.840
That list is 99% complete,

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.170
it's practically done.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.560
Nothing in this world is 100% perfect.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.840
For me,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.480
life must be 100% perfect.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.920
Time has limits,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.000
but perfection doesn't.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.360
Something's fishy about Chen Qing's situation.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.840
Let's help her solve it quickly,

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.240
the sooner we finish, the sooner we go home.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.280
I just want what's best for you.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.000
Then please take back your kindness,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.200
stop meddling in other people's lives on your own accord.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.060
Don't be so presumptuous.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.200
What are you doing here?

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.440
I'm here to tell you

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.020
that I regret letting you join this team.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.480
It seems

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.290
I've made things too comfortable for you.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.080
Director.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.900
She's threatening me, isn't she?

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.560
This plot

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.560
is even more melodramatic than the show we're filming.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.240
I suggest you be careful.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.040
It's not the thief who steals that's worrying, but the one who keeps eyeing your stuff.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.780
Why did you ask me to come here?

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.680

I didn't want to have a baby either,

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.000
but since someone couldn't get pregnant,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.560
I had to be generous and have one for you.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.240
What exactly do you want?

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.640
Do you know why I hate you so much

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.100
and still cast you as the second female lead?

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.440
You're being salty.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.440
Because I'm not only going to steal your boyfriend,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.040
but also make you completely leave the entertainment industry.
