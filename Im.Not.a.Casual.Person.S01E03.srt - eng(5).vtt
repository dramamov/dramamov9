00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.720
Do you know why I hate you so much

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.520
and still let you play the supporting female role?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.660
Too much salt in your diet?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.360
Because I'm not only going to steal your boyfriend,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.160
but also make you completely get out of the entertainment industry.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.880
Come on, lady.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.200
Ms. Chen! Ms. Chen!

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.840
Ms. Chen, are you okay?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.640
Are you hurt? Where did you fall?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.900
Call an ambulance!

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.960
Call an ambulance!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.800
Hurry!

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.160
Call 120 quickly!

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.880
What happened? Did anyone see what happened?

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.680
I don't know, but Qingqing is hurt.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.000
Oh my god, Qingqing!

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.160
I'm fine.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.640
Zheng Ying didn't do it on purpose.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.400
Please don't blame her.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.120
Oh my god, she did it deliberately!

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.440
What a cruel woman!

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.800
She's jealous of our Qingqing's beauty and popularity.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.079
Our sweet Qingqing is so kind and innocent

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.680
and still speaks well of her.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.400
Qingqing is just too nice.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.360
But we can't let her be bullied like this

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.800
Don't let that woman get away with it!

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.680
- Let's go.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.660
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.840
You can't do this.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.760
You can't do this.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.720
Catch her!

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.320
You can't do this!

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.850
Let's go!

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880
Stop them!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200
Something this serious happened

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.640
and you're still eating snacks?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.500
You're really not worried at all.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.800
Isn't she fine?

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.360
I didn't touch her,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.400
nor did I get near her.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.360
The truth will come to light.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.680
Justice is in people's hearts.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.880
What do I have to fear?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.240
Look.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.640
But what everyone sees is Chen Qing inciting keyboard warriors

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.170
to fabricate the truth in the name of justice.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.530
These are all photos from my acting roles.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.360
May I ask your opinion on the recent

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.600
pushing incident that's trending online?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.040
Pushing someone is wrong no matter where it happens.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.720
This kind of behavior is illegal, isn't it?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.600
I've known Chen Qing for a long time.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.280
She's a very sweet and gentle girl.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.320
And according to my friend

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.680
who witnessed this on set,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.160
this incident is actually true.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.000
Get out of the production!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.560
Get out of the production!

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.000
Leave the entertainment industry!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.360
Get out completely!

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.960
I found it.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.600
Chen Qing hired people to manipulate public opinion.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200
But you're personally delivering yourself to her doorstep.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.320
What do you mean I'm delivering myself?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.920
I'm opening a door for her.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.720
Mr. Shen.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.640
What?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.040
Well...

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.900
I've heard about your recent situation.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.240
Do you need help?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.440
Right now,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.280
asking me for help

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.880
is your best solution.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.220
So why are you still...

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.600
I do need help.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.360
I know with your abilities,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.620
you could definitely solve my problems.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.480
But I'll say it again.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.520
My own problems,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.200
I'll handle them myself.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.180
Should we go after him?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.440
No need.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.520
That was such a good opportunity.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.250
Why didn't you ask for his help?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.120
Are you afraid

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.920
the crew will gossip about you two again?

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.040
Gossip is just gossip. It's not true.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.280
I can solve my own problems.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.640
Didn't Zheng Banqiao once say,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.680
Eat your own food, sweat your own sweat,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.680
rely on heaven, earth, and ancestors,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.960
and you're no real man.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.050
Did Zheng Banqiao really say that?

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.960
Of course he did.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.880
Alright.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.000
I guess I wasn't wrong about you.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.460
I'll go borrow some money.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.060
What do you need money for?

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.040
To hire internet trolls.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.640
We need to suppress the public opinion, right?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.900
I never expected Wan Yuchen to speak up for justice.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840
I have an idea.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.680
What idea?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.680
Wan Yuchen likes acting,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.440
and loves criticizing even more.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.840
But what he loves most

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.400
is gossip.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.970
He was filming from across the camera.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.600
Facing Chen Qing directly.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.460
He must have captured something.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.720
Quick.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.480
Tell us your story.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.680
I'm really not a gossip.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.240
I really don't know anything.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.760
Please stop asking me.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.920
Then what about that post you made

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.920
saying I was framed?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.320
Did you see something?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.720
Otherwise, you two-faced person,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.520
why are you suddenly so righteous and brave?

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.050
Aren't you afraid your agent will shelve you?

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.140
I don't give a damn.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.680
My contract expires in six months.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.810
Is he going to shelve me for six months?

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.120
I...

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.640
I posted that

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.480
just to get some attention.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.380
So you really didn't see anything

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.560
or hear anything?

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.960
Sister,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.400
I really am not a gossip.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.400
I just happened to pass by there.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.980
Don't think I'm scamming you by taking your 300.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.130
These are the female lead and second lead of our show.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.320
Whenever these two are together,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.780
it's always spectacular.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.920
Will there be juicy gossip tomorrow?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.600
If you want to know,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.720
join group 25.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.640
Do you know why I hate you so much

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.450
yet still want you to play the second female lead?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.800
I'll get right on it.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.200
Great!

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.380
I'll never complain about your gossip habit again.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.080
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.560
I just happened to be passing by.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.320
My shoelace just happened to come undone.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.000
I just happened to squat down to tie it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.520
I just happened to overhear your conversation.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.050
And I just happened to record it with my phone.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.920
Your 'just happened'

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.480
just happened to save me.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.050
How perfectly convenient!

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.360
What's wrong?

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.660
Where does it hurt?

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.680
I'm feeling upset right now.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.960
I originally wanted to use some tricks to drive her away.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960
But now

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.039
there are even more people sympathizing with her online.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:32.880
Why don't we

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.640
just let it go?

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.600
She's just a D-list celebrity.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.440
You're on a different level, right?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.840
Don't stoop to her level.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.320
What?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.580
Are you feeling sorry for her now?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.880
You can proceed now.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.240
Solving problems with your own abilities

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.400
feels good, doesn't it?

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.730
Of course it feels good.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.320
After this video was released,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.520
netizens said they misunderstood you before,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.920
and they've all turned from haters to fans.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.400
Look, you really can't tell

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.360
that it's her.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.920
What's wrong?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.260
#Guan Naiying#

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.680
I...

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.330
I'll go wait backstage. See you later.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.000
Using such despicable means.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.560
Get out of the entertainment industry! Get out of our crew!

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.880
Tell the crisis PR department

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.680
to respond within half an hour.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.600
What is she doing?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.600
Why hasn't she come to me yet?

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.960
What's going on?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.920
Wait.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.600
I spent so much money,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.130
why can't I see our clarification statement?

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.600
Sorry, Mr. Yu,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.040
there are too many negative posts.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.760
They're all ranking ahead of us.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.800
We can't improve our metrics at all.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.840
I...

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.060
This show took me five years to write.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.960
Just the preparation alone took two years.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.920
We finally started shooting,

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.580
and I need to see it completed.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.600
So...

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.680
As for your character,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.680
I can only make her have an accident.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.240
You'll have to wrap up early.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.600
Mr. Shen,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.060
we've already mobilized the crisis PR team.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.600
But too many people are maliciously spreading rumors online.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.660
Public opinion online is still completely one-sided.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.280
You can tell she's not a good girl.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.080
What decent girl would take photos like these?

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.040
The rumors about our Qingqing on set a few days ago

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.440
might actually be true.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.560
My goodness, what kind of person is she?

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.160
Taking photos like these.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.760
The entertainment circle is such a mess, look.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.440
Mom?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.960
What's wrong?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:08.920
Nothing.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.040
Mom was just checking what you're doing.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.960
Look at you.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.180
You've lost weight in just a few days.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.880
I

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.240
just had dinner with some friends from the industry.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.200
I'm planning to see a movie later.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.840
Watching a movie is good.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.840
Relax a bit.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.650
My daughter did nothing wrong.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.720
You're all girls around the same age.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.800
Please stop criticizing her, okay?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.760
What time is the movie?

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.000
Tell Mom about it.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.080
Mom,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.250
my signal is bad here. I'll hang up now.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.130
Let me tell you something, Shen Yifan.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.720
I don't need you interfering in my affairs.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.840
I don't want anything to do with you.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.200
Everyone thinks I'm just riding on someone's coattails.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.200
Is this what you wanted to see?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.760
Are you trying to ruin me?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.120
But I'll say it again.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.120
My own problems,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.920
I'll handle them myself.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.000
She still

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.260
refuses to accept my help.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.680
Zheng Ying left immediately after finishing her scenes.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.040
Didn't even say goodbye.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.700
Can't reach her agent either.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.760
Find a way.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.640
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.680
Mr. Shen.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.580
Please just let her be.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.010
We need to catch our flight.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.080
Is this matter

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.200
destined to remain a regret?

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.400
I'll take your photo too.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.040
I don't like having my picture taken.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.680
Who doesn't like having their photo taken?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.880
Come on, skinny.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.280
Hurry up.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.240
Ready now.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.920
If you don't smile,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.580
I won't play with you anymore.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.330
Sweetheart.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.600
When someone bullies you,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600
the best response

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.200
isn't to hit back or yell back.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.960
It's to make yourself stronger,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.200
far surpassing them.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.960
Do you understand?

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.240
Yes, Mom.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.400
I understand.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.400
I'll definitely make myself stronger,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.600
so I can protect you.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.400
Alright, let's go.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.440
Do you know why I hate you so much

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.800
yet still had you cast as the second female lead?

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.280
Because I not only want to steal your boyfriend,

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.560
but also want to kick you out of the entertainment industry for good.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.240
Don't let that woman get away!

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.160
As for your character,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.090
I can only make her have an accident

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.760
so you'll wrap up early.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.600
I spent so much money,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.660
why can't I see our clarification statement anywhere?

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.080
My daughter did nothing wrong.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.800
You're all girls of similar age.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.000
Please stop criticizing her, will you?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.960
Okay, I got it.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.400
The flight has been canceled due to weather conditions.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.200
Looks like we can't leave today.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.200
If it weren't for my help,

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.640
you would've been kicked out of the production team by now, you know that?

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.840
Coming to me for help now

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.160
is your best option.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.760
People with ability,

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.840
people with vision,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.000
are those who know how to utilize all resources around them.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.120
Becoming stronger with his help is still becoming stronger.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.520
I need to protect myself.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.820
I can't let my parents worry about me.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.980
You want me to help you?

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.560
Not help.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.920
It's cooperation.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.760
The kind that doesn't involve feelings.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.020
Purely professional.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.440
This is indeed a chance to leave no regrets.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.610
I can cooperate.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.720
But all cooperation has standards.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.320
For example,

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.640
what would count as successfully helping you?

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.600
I need to get through this crisis smoothly.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.840
And also,

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.720
I...

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.740
I want to be famous.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.080
Not super famous,

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.320
just more famous than Chen Qing and Gong Jing.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.450
Then they won't dare bully me anymore.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.840
You really are Little Red Zheng,

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.040
even your wish is just to be a little bit famous.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.700
The premise of cooperation is

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.440
both parties have something of equal value to exchange.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.800
I can make you famous,

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.320
but what can you offer me?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.800
I...

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.900
My body isn't good,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.260
and my emotions are worse.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.100
I don't have money either.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.840
Oh right,

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.440
you don't need money anyway.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.200
Let me think what else I'm good at.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.560
I can't give you anything right now.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.080
But I can make snacks,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.000
homemade with no additives.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.200
If you can imagine it,

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.560
I can make it.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.360
As long as you cooperate with me.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.560
I promise from now on,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.200
365 days a year,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.640
24 hours a day,

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.640
anytime, anywhere,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.200
whenever you need me,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.280
I'll bring snacks

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.210
and appear by your side right away.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.560
One year?

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.600
If you think one year isn't enough,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.400
then...

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.170
Three years.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.160
Five years, ten years.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.800
Enough.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.760
What's wrong?

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.840
I mean,

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.320
time isn't an issue for me.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.650
As long as you have time.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.920
I don't.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.520
What?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.440
I mean,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.200
it's a deal.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.240
You agreed.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.980
I believe you're worth it.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.920
Deal.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.880
How do you plan to help me?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.920
Hello, Mr. Shen.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.720
Is this his PR team?

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.080
They seem so powerful.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.200
Mr. Shen, the media coverage has been quite objective this time.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.440
But some marketing accounts are maliciously spreading rumors.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:50.970
Mr. Shen.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.000
We've released the facts to all major platforms.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.800
We've arranged to delete all photos related to Zheng Ying.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.280
Including chat records and reposts.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.720
Mr. Shen.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.240
We've compiled a list of all accounts with over 500 reposts.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.200
The statistics are complete.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.600
And have been handed over to the legal team.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.400
Yes, Mr. Shen.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.600
We've already sent legal notices

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.400
And filed police reports for some on the list.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.880
PR battles are public opinion battles.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.400
Brother,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.240
if we only send legal notices.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.040
He's so cool.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.640
It can intimidate some people,

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.900
but it won't change the public's impression of Zheng Ying.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.370
So what should we do?

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.780
Use both carrot and stick.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.100
Here's the script.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.160
Take a look at it.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.600
Just follow this when you speak.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.170
If you encounter any problems,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.080
you can quietly call me through your earpiece.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.680
I'll take over immediately.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.640
They're coming.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.440
Miss Zheng,

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.360
what's your opinion on

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.520
the recent trending topic online?

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.240
Is it true?

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.720
She's never experienced this kind of situation before.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.120
Let me handle it instead.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.660
Everyone please calm down, okay?

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.640
I know you all want to ask questions.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.320
Just a moment. One at a time, please.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.040
I promise to answer all your questions.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.280
Free of charge.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.920
Could you move your microphone back a bit?

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.400
It's almost in my mouth.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.600
And media friends over here.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.840
Could you move your camera a bit to the right?

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.680
This angle makes me look better.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.040
Don't worry.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.720
Everyone will have a chance to ask questions.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.040
Alright.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.120
Miss Zheng.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.920
Regarding those online articles about you,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.250
what are your thoughts?

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.480
My thoughts are

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.680
whoever wrote that article isn't a very good writer.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.720
After reading the whole thing,

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.160
I couldn't even tell what they were trying to say.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.880
So I'd like to remind everyone,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.040
when you pay someone to write promotional articles,

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.040
make sure to find someone who knows how to stir emotions.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.440
Just stirring up trouble isn't enough. It needs to be moving.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.400
As expected from Mr. Yu's artist.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.040
Of course.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.850
I discovered her after all.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.140
Miss Zheng.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.560
Regarding the matters mentioned in that article,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.240
are they true?

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.440
Which parts are true and which are false?

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.520
When you said I'm beautiful,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.800
I think that's true.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.520
May I ask what reason

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.520
made you take those kinds of photos?

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.680
Maybe it's because I have a good figure.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.240
You've been joking around for so long.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.840
Could you please answer my question directly?

Listen to me.

Now,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.100
bow and apologize.

Zheng Ying,

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:02.960
hurry up.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.920
Okay.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.560
So I'll directly address

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.440
several concerns everyone has.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.040
I, Zheng Ying,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.920
have never during work

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.960
hurt any colleague.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.080
I, Zheng Ying,

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.000
have never used improper means

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.640
to obtain any resources.

I, Zheng Ying,

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.200
during the honeymoon phase of my relationship,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.200
wanted to capture beautiful moments with my partner.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.640
Those are the photos everyone has seen.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.740
But I want to ask everyone:

Did I do something wrong?

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.400
What exactly did I do wrong?

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.280
The reason I

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.120
dare to stand here today

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.800
is to tell everyone

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.200
that I did nothing wrong.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.720
There's nothing wrong with taking photos showing my figure.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.000
There's nothing wrong with me being in a relationship.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.860
Even if the relationship failed,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.420
I still did nothing wrong.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.360
What's wrong is the person who betrayed my feelings,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.800
broke my trust,

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.320
and tainted love.

How was it?

Wasn't my performance excellent?

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.960
Do you think I would invest

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.290
so much effort in a fool?

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.280

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.460
What's the first clause in our contract?

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.480
I... I forgot.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.920
The first clause states that

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.440
for any matter, at any time,

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.240
you must listen to me.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.240
Do you realize you've already breached the contract?

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.960
The foundation of a contract

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.760
is based on mutual trust.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.300
By acting this way,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.260
should I understand that you don't trust me?

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.980
Please give me one reason.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.680
Otherwise, someone like you who breaches contracts

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.960
and undermines the spirit of cooperation,

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.490
I have no reason to continue working with you.

Let me explain.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640
I didn't follow the script earlier

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.760
because we were in a rush

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.640
and I couldn't memorize it.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.640
What about later?

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.280
Later...

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.540
later I felt the script wasn't right.

As for the specific content,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.660
just go with what she said.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.080
Well...

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.240
Mr. Shen,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.800
I think you lost

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.930
that argument just now.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.480
Nonsense.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.810
I just want everyone to know

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.340
that I'm not wrong.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.930
There's nothing wrong with showing off my figure in photos.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.080
You're quite impressive.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.520
Ying.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.160
Please trust me.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.880
I want to talk to you in person

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.010
to apologize to you.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.640
There's no trust between us.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.080
No feelings either.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.260
So there's nothing to talk about.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.160
Also,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.480
you don't need to apologize to me

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.000
because I will never forgive you.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.760
Go ahead.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.360
Our cooperation is based on trust, isn't it?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.930
Isn't trust supposed to be mutual?

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.080
So in your eyes,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.900
I really did something wrong.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.850
I need to apologize, right?

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.400
This time,

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.840
it seems I was wrong.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.280
You know,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.080
Someone as uncontrollable as her

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.680
could cause all kinds of trouble in the future.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.960
Is she really trustworthy?

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.880
You're right.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.280
To avoid problems,

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.820
I need to complete the contract as soon as possible.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.770
Stay away from her as soon as possible.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.680
Mr. Shen.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.480
If you don't like working in their office,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.840
we can switch to our own place right away.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.360
No need.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.440
My goal is to make her famous.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.300
Being close to her saves time.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.600
Mr. Shen, let's have a talk.
