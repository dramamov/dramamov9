00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.600
I want to see

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.800
what new insults people have today.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.400
I watched your video

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.930
and I'm here to support you.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.960
Stay true to yourself, protect yourself, and don't be afraid!

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.800
Beautiful, cute, and with good values, though not yet famous.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.080
I'm here to apologize to you.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.320
I insulted you before.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.040
You have such good values.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.920
You're absolutely right.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.720
Just a random viewer who found you from your video.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.759
I'll follow you from now on.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.560
Keep going!

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.040
Those who spread those photos will be punished.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.120
Stay true to yourself, protect yourself, and don't be afraid.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.200
Take more photos in the future to annoy them.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.000
Keep it up!

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.180
You have a great figure, you're beautiful and cute,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.840
and have good values despite not being famous yet.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.240
Following you!

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.820
What delicious food are you having tonight?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.120
I...

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.210
I've gained so many followers.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.280
Mr. Shen,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.280
aren't you worried

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.079
With your fame

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.960
she might take advantage of your good reputation?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.600
She could tell everyone

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.280
that she's your woman

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.010
and use you as a stepping stone.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.200
This Chen Qing is really ridiculous.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.160
She even dares to speak so boldly to you.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.490
Now that Xu Zhiyou is no longer her backer,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.520
she naturally needs to find a new one.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.400
Too bad

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.600
she picked the wrong person.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.330
But she did say one thing right.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.700
What else could

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.280
make her famous overnight better than

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.210
claiming to be Shen Yifan's woman?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.040
I'm sorry, it's not about the standards.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.970
Mr. Shen never attends any events.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.360
Could it be up ahead?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.280
I think so. Let's go.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.410
I can't believe I was recognized despite this disguise.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.560
Then I'll proceed as you instructed

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.280
right away.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.180
Come in.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.120
Good morning, my golden goose.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.040
According to our contract

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.920
This is the first batch of tribute for you.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.720
Please accept it, God of Wealth.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.840
This is your compensation.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.000
Regarding my negative news,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.920
hasn't it been mostly taken care of?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.960
I'd like to ask about my upcoming work schedule,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.280
God of Wealth.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.520
We have an equal partnership.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.760
From now on, don't call me

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.360
God of Wealth anymore.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480
Okay, Wea-

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.520
What should we do next?

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.800
A person's energy is limited.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.240
A proper balance of work and rest

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.960
will help you with your upcoming work.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.880
I've been criticized so much lately

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.680
for not having any roles. I've been resting for too long.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680
Besides,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.280
your idea of relaxation for me

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.560
is just shopping and browsing stores.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.100
Not just shopping,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.680
but casual shopping.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.960
If you don't like that,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.400
we can also...

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.000
Who wouldn't like shopping while getting paid?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.800
Let's go

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320
and shop.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.120
Is everything ready?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.240
Don't worry,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.600
here,

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.640
our people are all in position,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.600
ready to go.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.760
[Shen Yifan takes Zheng Ying shopping]

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.770
Why can't I find anything I want to buy?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
Never mind. Let's look around more.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.200
I thought you liked all of these.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.360
Why aren't you buying anything?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.640
The point of window shopping isn't about buying things.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.920
The focus is on browsing,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.720
not buying. Got it?

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.130
[Execute Plan B]

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.210
[Shen Yifan takes Zheng Ying for a romantic meal]

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.159
We can photograph them eating,

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.320
but how do we capture the romance?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.370
Are you okay, Mr. Cheng?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.400
The elevator is here.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.330
Come on, be careful. Let's go home.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.600
Get in, get in.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.600
Mr. Cheng!

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.880
Wait for me!

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.960
Hello?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.120
Is this property management?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.320
This is Cheng Moyang.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.140
What's wrong with you people?

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.020
This is a high-end residence.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.500
Not everyone should be allowed in, okay?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.659
Tell the security to be more vigilant next time.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.170
It's a high-end residence, yet anyone can buy in?

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.960
Mr. Cheng,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960
on your desk are the company's

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.090
recently contacted artists' photos.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.640
Why are these still the same people?

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.920
Take a look at the one in the black qipao.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.800
Her name is Zheng Ying.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.730
She's just gained some popularity online recently.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.039
Tonight,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.960
isn't there an investment circle cocktail party?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.600
Yes, they did invite us.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.120
As usual, I declined right away.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.120
Shen Yifan, who never attends events,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.420
shows up with a female companion.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.050
What would everyone think?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.280
Hello, are you Miss Zheng Ying?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.160
Yes, that's me.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.360
Here's your package.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.040
Thank you.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.920
This is truly

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.640
an expensive-looking qipao,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.700
even without checking the price tag.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.280
And

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.080
the color

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.240
and style...

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.420
Why does it have this indescribable sense of intimacy?

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.440
What is Shen Yifan trying to say?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.640
Mr. Shen will take you to an event tonight.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.560
Get ready.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.200
Could it be

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.400
he's finally introducing me to directors and producers?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.040
Mr. Cheng,

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.850
the items have been delivered.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.480
That's fine.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.600
Among all those documents,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.560
she's probably the only one who can make sense of them.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.560
She probably didn't expect me to notice her,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.020
let alone send her a qipao.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.090
Quite a surprise, isn't it?

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040
I'm here.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.240
How do I look?

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.370
You're late.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.440
It's because of this outfit you sent me.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.520
It took me half an hour to squeeze into it.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.810
I just realized I forgot to touch up my makeup.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.130
Good thing I brought it with me.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.400
You can read those documents

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.860
with just one hand, right?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.160
Then hold this for me,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.690
so I can do my makeup faster.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.280
Done.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.320
So women

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.320
really can do makeup in a moving car.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.720
Of course.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.520
I couldn't do it at first either.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.800
The car shakes so much

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.160
I couldn't hold anything steady.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.480
Later, when filming, I often had to move between scenes.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.040
My roles were too small for the crew to prioritize my makeup,

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.080
so I had to gradually train myself.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.240
Now I can even

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.360
do my eyebrows and lipstick at the same time in a car.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.360
Impressive, right?

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.040
Seems like these past few years haven't been easy for her.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.240
But why can she always be so optimistic?

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.880
Mr. Cheng.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.960
If the chairman knows you're really here,

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.320
he'll be delighted.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.800
How did he end up coming here?

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.760
That's so rare.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.080
The atmosphere today seems much livelier than before.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.560
Isn't that because my presence

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.020
has brought glory to this humble gathering?

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.880
Yes, absolutely.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.160
That's right.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.320
Being able to see him today

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.760
is truly wonderful.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.480
Alright then.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.640
I'll give you all a chance to get to know me.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.240
Yes.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.400
Mr. Shen.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.480
is someone who

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.040
you can never see on ordinary days.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.520
Look at Shen Yifan, Mr. Shen,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.440
a genius prodigy, a legend in the investment world.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.000
Who is Mr. Shen?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.240
A face more striking than any celebrity's.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.840
What do they call it online?

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.720
Goddess Nuwa's masterpiece,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.440
right?

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.560
But even though that's what they say,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.440
does he really have no flaws at all?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.760
If you want to talk about his flaws,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.440
it's that he never attends business functions or socializes.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.160
And

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.770
importantly, he's never had any rumors or gossip about him.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.640
Yes.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.570
Mr. Shen is here.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.880
These people don't look like

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.720
producers or directors at all.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.400
I hope there aren't any reporters around

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.200
who might photograph us together

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.480
and start some gossip.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.690
Don't worry.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.170
No one will take sneaky photos.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.320
Mr. Shen, you never attend any events.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.360
May I ask what brings you

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.520
here this time?

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.480
What?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.520
Are we not

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.400
welcome?

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.520
You two?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.240
Let me formally introduce you. This is Zheng Ying.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.320
She's an actress.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.840
May I ask what your relationship is?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.280
Shen Yifan.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800
Do you enjoy playing games with me?

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.880
I'm not playing games with you.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.000
The contract states

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.440
that artists have the right to know about everything.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.160
Shen Yifan, I need to know

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.930
what exactly you're doing.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.360
I'm making you famous.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.120
So this is how you plan to make me famous?

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.200
Using my status and position to highlight you.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.160
This is the best strategy to make you famous right now.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.360
The best strategy?

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.160
You mean the fastest way.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.160
I came to you because of your expertise.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.960
I thought you would discover my strengths

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.960
and help me plan my career properly.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.680
I never expected you'd use this method.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.720
Anyone could do that, couldn't they?

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.400
I just wanted to be more efficient.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.800
But let me tell you something, Shen Yifan.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.200
I want to succeed through my own efforts,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.760
climbing step by step,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.760
not by being linked to someone in gossip

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.890
or getting attention through some made-up background.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.320
She's wearing the clothes I gave her.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.720
It fits her perfectly. She looks stunning.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.600
But why is she here?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.320
Did she hear I would be here

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.120
and came specifically to see me?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.600
I...

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.410
What's her game?

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.840
Deliberately pretending to ignore me

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.080
to get my attention.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.720
Playing hard to get.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.160
She's quite the schemer.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.360
Interesting.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.840
Before you actually let me audition,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.160
I won't cooperate.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.880
All the photos taken by reporters

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.560
have been completely destroyed.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.200
But she still won't answer her phone.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.280
This is outrageous.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.720
What is she trying to do?

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.180
She's using a strike to blackmail me.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:56.960
Ridiculous.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.640
How could we be blackmailed by her?

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.840
This standoff won't solve anything.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.130
It's just wasting time.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.720
We can't continue like this.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.440
Mr. Shen, you're not thinking of compromising,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.890
are you? That's not like you at all.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.400
Maybe I shouldn't quibble with my creditor.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.960
One shouldn't give up money just for dignity.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.440
But I really don't want to become famous through hype.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.080
I need to live up to those who support me.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.920
Even though there aren't many.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.720
Brother.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.900
Don't say that.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.080
Considering that every time I look into your eyes,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.140
I always soften up.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.080
Today,

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.180
I absolutely won't look at your eyes.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.800
Alright,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.800
we can officially start our conversation now.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.800
About you telling the doctor to give up treatment,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.520
I won't pursue this matter with you today.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.400
But tell me,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.960
did you sign a contract with Zheng Ying

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.020
to make her famous?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.660
Let's go. We're almost there.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.280
Ling.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:17.720
It's that room.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.200
I never submitted my profile for this production.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.960
Besides,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.320
they should contact my agent Youyi first for auditions.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.600
Why are we coming here?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.120
And they specifically asked me to wear these clothes.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.520
With our relationship, would I ever lie to you?

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.720
I need to take this call. You go in first.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.680
Go on now.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.080
I've brought her as requested.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.880
You must cast me in your next production. Bye-bye.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.240
Are you trying to make her famous

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.280
by staying up late

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.600
researching the domestic film market?

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.130
As long as she's not famous,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.600
you'll have to stay here?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.400
Why?

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.600
Tell me why.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.720
Tell me why you're helping her like this.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720
Tell me, brother.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.140
Do you believe in love at first sight?

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.240
Come.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.160
Sit here.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.480
Move closer to me.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.000
Who are you? Why would I move closer to you?

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.240
Fine.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.040
I want to see what you're really up to.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.200
So?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.330
Do you like this outfit?

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.200
You gave me this qipao.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.560
I know that someone who won't live long

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.490
doesn't deserve to have feelings.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.040
But I just can't control myself.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.680
Before I'm gone,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.280
I want to do everything for her.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.320
Before I leave,

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.920
I want to solve all her problems.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.320
Before I'm gone...

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:10.720
Bro.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.080
Mr. Shen.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:13.920
Mr. Shen.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.480
My poor little brother.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.120
Mr. Shen.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.040
Mr. Shen.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.240
Young Mr. Shen.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.520
Deceiving the senior Mr. Shen like this,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.040
isn't that a bit wrong?

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.920
When you two conspired to deceive me

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.840
and didn't tell me he was coming,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.080
why didn't you think that was wrong?

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.000
Hey.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.720
Mr. Shen,

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.170
something's happened.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:10.960
What?

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.520
Next time before hitting someone,

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.580
I should take off my high heels first.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.450
Why are you here?

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.160
As a performer,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.760
not only are you uncooperative with my work,

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.490
but now you're hitting people.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.240
Why don't you ask me why I hit him?

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.960
Whatever the reason, you shouldn't have done that.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.560
You're not cooperating with my work,

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.600
wasting my time,

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.960
and affecting my efficiency.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.440
You're gambling with your own future

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.970
and making a joke of my time.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.800
Efficiency, always efficiency.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.400
Shen Yifan, let me tell you something.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.840
Efficiency doesn't mean I have no principles or bottom line.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.970
Efficiency doesn't mean I have to tolerate everything.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.320
She caused such a big problem and still acts like

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.000
she's in the right. No wonder you're angry.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.960
So what should we do next?

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.860
Let's start with what interests her.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.410
That way she'll cooperate.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.400
What interests her...

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.600
That would be acting.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.520
Are we really going to use acting

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.200
to start from scratch, step by step?

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.330
When will we be able to make her famous?

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.520
Did you get the video?

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.690
This is the restaurant's surveillance footage.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.440
So that's how it happened.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.440
You don't need to be so moved by today's arrangements.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.080
What are you doing?

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.440
Do you know who I am?

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.560
I'm warning you.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.180
I'm the chairman of Yiping Sunshine Future.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.490
Driving such a nice car,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.760
why are you littering?

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.760
Don't do it again.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.120
Are you sure you brought me here for an audition?

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.020
Where is your Mr. Shen?

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.560
Whether it's an audition or not,

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.480
just go in and see for yourself.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.200
Why didn't our Mr. Shen come?

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.600
Don't you have any idea?

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.040
Hello, Director.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.960
Our actress is here.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.400
Good.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.810
That's more like it.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.200
Thank you for your hard work.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.060
How's it going?

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.400
You know, Shen Yifan

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.860
has fought for so many opportunities for me.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.800
Why can't I seize even one of them?

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.720
What? Thinking of giving up?

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.600
No way.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.680
I'm not someone who gives up easily.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.410
I just regret not being ambitious enough before.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.000
Come in.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.160
Hello, Director.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.480
Good day, Director.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:16.920
Hello.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.560
Mr. Shen asked us to come see you.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.720
Mr. Liang told me

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.440
that Mr. Shen is recommending an actress today.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.280
This is a role I've reserved

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.760
based on the actress's image.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.200
It's the second female lead.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.000
A gentle and elegant lady from a good family.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.440
It's quite a good character.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.120
Take a look.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.240
Thank you.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.490
Alright, Mr. Liang.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.680
I understand.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.080
Mr. Shen says

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.920
you should audition for Lingzi's role.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.640
Lingzi?

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.200
Isn't Lingzi just a featured role?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.600
What if I hurt someone? Do I have to pay compensation?

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.280
Don't worry.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.440
We'll be careful. You won't get hurt.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.720
I'm more concerned about hurting you guys.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.480
So young yet so cocky.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.730
Let's see what you've got then.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.240
This role requires a professional martial arts performer.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.880
An ordinary person can't handle it.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.400
Why did Director Shen let her audition for this role?

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.130
Perhaps he has a unique vision.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.600
Shen Yifan asked me to try this role.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.160
Did he discover my martial arts skills

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.320
and want me to try a different acting path?

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:49.840
Good.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.760
Lingzi, you got the part.
