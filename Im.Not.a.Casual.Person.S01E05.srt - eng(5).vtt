00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.330
Brother,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.479
this is my first time trying an action scene.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.539
It's so thrilling!

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.729
I need to take this call.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.520
Hello?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.800
Surprised? Didn't expect this, did you?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.200
Wan Yuchen!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.770
Miss Zheng Ying.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.920
I have two things to tell you.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.720
First.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.600
I'm joining the cast of 'Long Fall to Phoenix'

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.440
to play your official love interest.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.280
Really?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.680
And the second thing is...

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.280
I'm joining your agency

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.520
to become your colleague.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.450
To become your family and partner.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.800
That's great!

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.280
Your Lingzi role is gone.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.480
No wonder each audition falls through.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.400
So it was Cheng Moyang behind all this.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.320
That's what happens when you lose your temper and hit someone.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.120
Now you've lost the role and you're full of regret.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.000
I was wrong to hit him.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.240
But he was asking for it.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.360
Cheng Moyang has taken all the roles.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.200
Didn't Shen Yifan fight back at all?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.240
Even the Lingzi role that was already confirmed,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.400
he just handed it over to Cheng Moyang.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.860
What kind of logic is that?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.280
No way.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.970
I need to find him and get some answers.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680
Zheng Ying.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.360
I don't believe

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.290
you won't come and apologize to me.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.520
Open the door!

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.560
Shen Yifan!

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.880
You have the nerve to stay inside,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.810
now have the nerve to open the door!

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.240
Don't think that just because you're quiet,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.640
I don't know you're home.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.140
Shen Yifan!

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.120
Shen Yifan, open up!

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.940
Shen Yifan, open the door!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.130
What are you doing here?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.140
I should be the one asking what you're doing.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.600
Cheng Moyang is trying to destroy us completely,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.800
and you're acting like nothing's wrong.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.600
Come with me to meet someone now.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.280
Why do we have to talk here?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.240
Shen Yifan, I just want to ask you one thing.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.280
I got into trouble,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.480
but aren't we contracted allies?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.920
Are you just going to stand by

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.720
and watch me get bullied?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.920
Is that the kind of person you think I am?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.160
What's the point of our partnership?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.089
Then why don't we

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.600
terminate our contract?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.060
Fine, let's terminate it.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.800
Are you sure?

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.120
I'm sure, certain,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.980
and absolutely positive.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.160
Okay.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.840
Remember what you just said.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.620
Don't regret it later.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.040
Mr. Shen, am I late?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.840
No.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.800
Here.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680
Please, this way.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.400
Come.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.720
Mr. Shen,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.659
sorry to keep you waiting.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.120
If I'm not mistaken,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.680
that man is the internationally famous martial arts actor,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.480
Zhou Zheng, Master Zhou, right?

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.880
And the one next to him

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.680
won Best Director at the Caska Awards last year.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.410
I heard they're preparing for 'Duel of Beauties'

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.200
with a top-tier team.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.400
Plus,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.280
they've invited Zhou Zheng, who hasn't worked for years.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.800
Due to the information blackout,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.600
very few people know about this.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.490
So what does all this have to do with Cheng Moyang?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.240
I heard they're filming in China

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.040
and looking for Chinese actors.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.640
Yiping Sunshine has so many A-list artists,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.080
they'll definitely compete for it.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.640
If we try to compete,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.700
we don't stand a chance at all.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.200
So,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.480
this is all Shen Yifan's plan?

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.720
Cheng Moyang's goal is just to get revenge on me.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.720
That's why Shen Yifan deliberately split up with Wu Yubing.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.520
Have Wu Yu arrange my audition domestically

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.380
while he goes abroad to contact the directing team.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.520
To divert Cheng Moyang's attention

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.840
and let him indulge in the pleasure of revenge against me.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.080
And for revenge,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.240
I scheduled all artists under our company to be fully booked.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.560
This way, even if he wants to steal this film,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.560
he won't have any actors available.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.480
Boss,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.040
these are the thirty films she's signed for.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.120
She's the lead in every one.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.960
Which one should we take?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.280
Take them all. I don't care what roles.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.240
No matter how much it costs, get them all.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.640
Send out all the artists

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.640
from our company.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.840
I want to leave her with nothing to film.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.760
So

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.120
he deliberately gave up those films.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.840
Just to create the illusion that we're failing miserably.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.160
When in fact, he's secretly making his move.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.420
To catch him off guard.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.940
And then successfully take on this film.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.600
But you just told me

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.040
that you terminated the contract with Shen Yifan.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.920
He's still not back so late.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.360
Must be dealing with my issues

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.930
and entertaining Master Zhou and others.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.810
What are you doing here?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.159
I'm sorry.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.440
I was wrong.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.040
Wrong about what?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.280
I was wrong

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.720
because of my ignorance.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.120
I was rash, foolish, shortsighted,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.760
and judged your noble character with my petty mind.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.130
Your self-assessment is quite accurate.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.740
You do have many flaws,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.520
but your self-awareness

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.240
is commendable.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.760
Yes, yes.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.640
Your assessment is even more accurate.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.760
This is my apology gift to you.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.960
I hope you'll be generous and not hold it against me.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.490
First of all,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.290
the contract states

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.820
that snacks should be provided for free,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.160
so this doesn't count as an apology gift.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.220
Secondly, about you hitting Mo Yang,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.200
do you think what you did was right?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.920
I...

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.250
I don't think I did anything wrong.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.200
Indeed.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.039
Although I'm someone who extremely values efficiency,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.200
at the same time,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.039
I ignored your feelings.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.240
It made you resistant

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.650
and affected our cooperation.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.500
You did nothing wrong.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.040
Your approach may not be the optimal solution,

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.770
but it certainly wasn't wrong.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.480
You really think I wasn't wrong?

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.650
I shouldn't have tolerated it?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.900
You weren't wrong.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.800
And with me here,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.060
you don't need to tolerate anything.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.610
Cheng Moyang, listen to me.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.960
I don't care what kind of women you want.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.080
But you absolutely cannot mess with Shen Yifan's woman.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.140
Do you understand?

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.690
So I can't touch his woman, huh?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.880
Then I'll go after her.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.680
While I don't quite agree with some companies

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.680
that treat artists completely as commodities,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.880
I do acknowledge that

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.960
certain qualities of an artist

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.290
can be commercialized.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.160
Can you speak plain English?

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.160
Good point. Artists need to face the market,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.160
so they must understand the market.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
The best approach to commercialization

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.560
is to utilize the unique qualities of each artist.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.220
Otherwise,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.240
no matter how many personas we create,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.000
for the artists,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.880
they're just masks they use to disguise themselves.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.000
Only by truly utilizing their strengths

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.730
can they eventually stand out.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.760
I know.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.400
I know what my strength is.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.840
Being beautiful.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.800
Compared to them,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.000
are you pretty enough?

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.040
I have a great figure.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360
Compared to them,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.960
are your advantages outstanding enough?

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.600
I...

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.120
I have a kind personality.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.080
No celebrity

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.360
is liked by the public

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.890
just because they're kind.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.920
So am I really good for nothing?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.720
Of course not.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.000
Then tell me,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.640
what are my strengths?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.920
Zheng Ying,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.400
martial arts is your shining point.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.560
It's your unique advantage.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.040
Female celebrities who know martial arts are rare.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.760
You need to seize your opportunities,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.120
make the most of your strengths,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.380
only then can you carve out your own path.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.160
Doesn't seem like it's snack day today.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.400
These snacks today

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.680
shine with the light of friendship

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.300
and flow with harmonious goodwill. Let's talk nicely.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.000
Let's make up.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.560
Didn't you

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.640
just apologize to me the other day?

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.480
Yes,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.120
but now I want to formally

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.450
and sincerely express my attitude to you.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.560
Refusing your arrangements before

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.040
showed poor work ethic on my part.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.720
Please forgive me.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.840
You went against my wishes

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.120
and made me do things I didn't want to do.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.320
I forgive you too.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.920
So let's forgive each other

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.020
and make up right here.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.240
By the way,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.120
how did you know I like action scenes?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.080
Of course I know.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.480
Right,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.120
the first time we met,

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.520
I showed off my skills saving you, didn't I?

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.920
Actually...

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.480
Well...

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
Before,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.730
I wasn't really serious about acting.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.240
I've wanted to be a hero since I was little,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.200
but the company made me act like a lady.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.720
I really couldn't connect with those roles -

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.760
all that seduction

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.680
and talking in circles.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.640
So thank you so much this time

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.370
for helping me fulfill my wish.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.560
I came here to help you realize your dreams anyway.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.160
Don't worry, I definitely won't let you down.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.010
Don't believe me? Look.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.200
See how great my dodging is?

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.200
This flexibility

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.520
isn't something ordinary actresses can achieve.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.520
I also have a brick-breaking move

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.650
that I've recorded.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.120
I have several more techniques to show you.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.040
She seems

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
to still be the same Zheng Xiaohong.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.920
Still that shining female warrior.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.960
I'm sorry,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.280
Miss Chen.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.480
Your studio doesn't meet my investment criteria.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.120
I know my studio is small,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.320
but we've just signed a new male actor.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.040
His name is Zhang Zhang.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.480
You want to say he has the potential to become a star?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.080
Do you know how many times I hear that every day?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.240
The reason I signed him

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.560
is because he fortunately passed the audition for 'Dual Beauties' Battle'

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.760
for this production.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.040
You're quite familiar with this production, aren't you, Mr. Cheng?

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.720
Today,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.080
he's going to Master Zhou's martial arts school

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.640
for intensive training.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.400
All cast members except Ni Shang, who has no action scenes,

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.860
will need to participate.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.280
Of course,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.720
although it's intensive training,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.520
staff from the actors' agencies

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.000
are still allowed to visit.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.800
Go ahead.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.010
What are your terms?

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.920
Why are you here?

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.400
I'm here to take you to Master Zhou's martial arts training camp.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.480
I've wanted to be a martial arts master since I was a child.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.040
Finally, I don't have to hide it anymore.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.520
I just don't know if I'll pass this training.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.180
You just need to perform well.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.560
Leave the rest to me.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.170
I need to perform exceptionally well.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.760
Master Zhou is both my father's and my idol.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.440
My childhood wish

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.770
was to become Master Zhou's disciple.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.680
I made this wish on every birthday.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.540
My dad was quite jealous about it.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.920
So do you

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.720
still have this wish now?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.720
Of course I do.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.000
So I must perform well

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.320
and try to get Master Zhou to accept me as his disciple.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.050
Master Zhou stopped accepting

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.820
new disciples five years ago.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.040
I'm confident I can make him open his doors again.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.040
I didn't expect you to put so much effort into this.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.200
Did you think these so-called dark snacks

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.460
were made carelessly?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.960
I, Zheng Ying, am not a careless person.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.440
By the way.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.040
Time was limited this time, so I only made these.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.240
Go ahead and try them.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.120
What about those?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.680
Those are all clothes.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.320
You know how women are.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.960
The martial arts school has standard training uniforms.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.620
You don't need to bring these.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:52.960
Wu Yu.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.040
Come in and get these things.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.520
Pack up all these clothes

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.920
and take them away with these boxes.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200
Robber.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.400
Mr. Zhou, I'll leave it to you then.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.370
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.480
Come on, let me show you around.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:38.880
Go ahead.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.010
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Zhou.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.960
Why do I feel like a father

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.420
dropping his daughter off at kindergarten?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.160
Welcome everyone to the pre-production training.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.880
About my personality,

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.840
you've probably heard something about it.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.800
Strict, rigid, unsympathetic.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.480
In my eyes, there are no celebrities, much less idols.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.000
I treat everyone equally.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.280
What you need to do is follow my instructions

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.680
and complete all training tasks with quality and efficiency.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.400
These stunt performers behind me

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.560
will supervise everyone.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.440
Start warming up.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.080
Yes.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.680
Come on.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.570
Let's go.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.600
Lower your waist. Good.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.410
Mr. Zhou, what will I be practicing later?

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.920
You'll find out soon.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:30.840
Turn.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.360
Right, open your hands

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.570
one, two, three, up.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.600
Then we continue with

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.400
one, two, three, and back again.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.400
One, two, three.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.600
Good.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.160
Ms. Zheng is amazing.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.640
She's clearly an expert.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.560
No, no.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.690
I'm far behind all my colleagues here.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.200
Mr. Shen.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.400
Only you can handle her strong flavors.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.200
I asked the doctor. It's fine to eat.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.360
By the way.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.340
How long has she been gone?

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.680
Just 2 hours.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.320
Are you waiting for an important call?

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.000
How's that bloody snack?

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.050
Besides eating,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.600
don't you have anything else to tell me?

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.400
This is where we train.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.040
This is what we eat.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.560
And there's no dinner.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.920
Go on.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.720
Alright, time's up.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.840
For this ab workout,

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.970
Xiaoqi is first, Zhengying is second.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.770
Why didn't you get first place?

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.880
Is he going to show off his signature move

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.440
the Whirlwind Kick?

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.640
I'm getting too old.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.400
Not as good as I used to be.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.280
Are you alright?

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:46.960
I'm fine.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.400
I'm fine.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.400
Master Zhou.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.320
Was that move you were practicing

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.760
the Whirlwind Kick?

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.200
Could you teach me?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.960
I don't teach outsiders.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.020
Then please take me as your disciple.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.170
I don't take disciples.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.600
But

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.660
you've had disciples before.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.200
That was in the past.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.840
Where's my takeout?

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.680
Did you order it?

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.840
Why are you here?

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.080
Is it because

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.520
I secretly ordered takeout instead of watching my figure

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.720
and you're angry?

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.360
Will he take away my takeout?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.120
Didn't you say before

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.130
that you wouldn't order takeout anymore?
