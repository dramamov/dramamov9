00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600
Skinny.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.640
Come on, let's go out and play.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.479
Play? What's the point?

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.680
It's a waste of time.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.160
How can playing be a waste of time?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.560
I'm going to jump down to you!

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.560
Don't jump! You'll break your legs.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440
Here I come!

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.480
Next time, stand back.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.840
It would be terrible if I landed on you.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.800
You have no idea.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.920
When I was little, I climbed over a wall

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.600
and fell right on top of a little boy.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.200
He ended up in the hospital.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.570
You still remember him?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.400
I just remember he was this fragile kid.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.760
No fun. Couldn't play with him at all.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.000
I forgot you're also quite fragile.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240
So awkward.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.000
Didn't you say

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.160
you wanted to become Master Zhou's student?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160
How's that going?

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.850
Master Zhou has clearly stated he won't take any more students.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.840
But no matter how difficult it is or how long it takes,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.970
I'm determined to become his student.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.480
After all, I'm a woman destined to become a martial arts actress.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.640
This kind of thing only increases your transaction costs.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.480
Costs?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.080
What costs?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.120
It includes

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.520
time,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.320
energy,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.450
and your communication costs.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.360
Not everything can be measured by

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.960
time,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.640
transactions,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.920
and costs.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.960
Time is life.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.400
If you don't manage your time well, you're wasting your life.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.880
Shen Yifan.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.240
In your twenty-something years of life,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.970
is there anything you particularly enjoy doing?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.600
You look great today,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.380
but next time we should shoot your left profile.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.240
I heard that award-winning actress Ni Shang

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.100
is also shooting a commercial in this studio today.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.120
It's none of your business. Why are you being so nosy?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.960
Ni Shang is here.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.720
Ni Shang!

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.560
Look!

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.000
Wait for me!

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.560
Hello, Ni Shang. I'm Wan Yuchen.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.560
Hello.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.400
Ms. Ni, please take a look at this.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.000
Latte.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.240
Go ahead.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.040
Latte.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.520
No, thanks.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.280
It's healthy. Pretty good.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.680
Ni Shang,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I heard you and Brother Youyi

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.200
graduated from the same school.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.460
Do you know each other?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.410
I don't know him.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.040
Really?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.450
Then why did I hear that?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.520
Don't we have a commercial to shoot?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.200
Let's go.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.120
Big news! Shocking news!

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.920
Gossip about Brother Youyi and international film star Ni Shang.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920
Interested?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.860
Who are you trying to fool?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.640
One's a toad and one's a swan.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.130
What gossip could they possibly have?

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.400
I've known Brother Youyi for years.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.560
You come to me with gossip about him?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.850
Is your brain shrinking or something?

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.440
What?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.480
I'm not here to sell you anything.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.880
I want to work with you.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.480
Together we can dig up something much bigger.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.200
Cooperate my ass.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.200
I have principles.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.480
How could I possibly betray our friend?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.040
What about a 60-40 split?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.880
You get 60, I get 40.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.240
Even 90-10 wouldn't work.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.160
Besides,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.320
you want me to believe there's chemistry between them?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.120
That's as likely as Shen Yifan having a crush on me.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.060
I'm hanging up.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.700
Is everyone ready?

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.540
Be good now.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.290
You can't do intense exercise.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.260
Come on.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.120
Get ready.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.080
On your mark.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.720
Go!

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.960
Would you give everything

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.000
for what you love?

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.360
Of course.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.640
Don't waste your effort.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.840
Just master the moves you need for filming.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.420
I've already mastered those.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.240
I'm practicing this just to challenge myself.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.760
Such a show-off.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.409
Master Zhou.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.080
Are you here for Zheng Ying?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.880
That's right.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.220
She admires you very much.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.720
And she loves martial arts.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.320
Passion and persistence are two different things.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.720
I don't want to waste my time

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.180
and energy on these impulsive celebrities.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.880
You're talking about

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.700
Liu Mu, aren't you?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.720
We have a good relationship.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.080
He mentions me every time he's on a show.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.960
At least he knows to be grateful.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Perhaps that's exactly the problem.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.760
Why would someone who earns a living

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.480
by their own merit use your name

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.210
to deceive people everywhere?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.440
How could someone who respects their teacher

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.280
not contact you for years

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.600
and only thank you

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.970
in front of cameras?

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.160
I can completely resolve

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.400
the Liu Mu situation for you.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.680
So in exchange,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.980
I must agree to take her as my student?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.400
Of course I hope you'll accept her as your student.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.460
But I don't want it to be because of me.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.919
The master-student relationship

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.120
depends on destiny.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.840
If I forced you through obligation,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.700
I would not only demean you

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.130
but also insult her.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.080
Taking on a student

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.000
is entirely up to you.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.400
I don't need your help,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.360
and I won't take her as my student.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.000
Goodbye.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.360
Mr. Shen, since he refuses to take her as a student,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.960
we shouldn't help him either.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.400
I believe he will definitely accept Zheng Ying as his student.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.200
As long as she works hard enough.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.520
Mr. Zhou, I...

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.120
Despite your cold exterior,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.680
like a stubborn old man,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.260
One day, I'll make you accept me as your apprentice.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.410
Still making Faustian bargains, aren't you?

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.840
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.240
Mr. Shen means that

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.160
your desire for this master-apprentice relationship

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.000
is blind worship

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.120
and obsession.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.360
You've already lost

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.600
your ability to judge the value of other things.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.360
Moreover,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.520
just because you didn't get

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.800
Mr. Zhou's approval,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.540
you tried to belittle him.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.960
You've been dismissing my efforts.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.720
Isn't that belittling me too?

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.450
It's not about belittling you.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.420
It's that your level of effort

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.500
is far from enough.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.440
Just you wait and see.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.040
Don't worry.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.240
We're already searching worldwide

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.320
for a suitable heart donor.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.320
So please don't give up, okay?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.360
Don't give up.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.660
Let me say it again.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.040
Come back as soon as possible

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.960
and rest properly

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.760
to be ready for surgery anytime.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.250
Will you do that?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.640
The probability of successfully finding a heart donor

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.160
is less than one in 100,000.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.520
The success rate of heart transplant surgery is less than 30%.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.880
Facts have proven there's no point in persisting anymore.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.320
You don't need to waste your efforts either.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.050
All Shen corporation projects

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.730
will be handed over to you soon.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.000
Shen Yifan.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.340
You promised you'd only return to China for six months.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.040
Shen Yifan.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.330
In your twenty-some years of life,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.160
is there anything you particularly enjoy doing?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.680
Would you be willing

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.080
to give everything for something you love?

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.880
Of course.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.410
What about you, Shen Yifan?

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.920
You've sprained your ankle.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.120
You've been overtraining. That's a big mistake.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.720
Here,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.160
let me take care of it.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.640
It's nothing.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.320
I can still train.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.420
You won't even listen to your master.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.400
You promised.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.620
You have to keep your word.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:31.890
Let's go.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.330
Take it slow.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720
It's not serious.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.400
Your leg strength is insufficient.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.720
Then I'll keep working on my legs.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.880
There will be a day when it's enough,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.080
right, Master?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.360
Take it easy these days.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.090
Stop practicing martial arts.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.240
Help stabilize her injury and take good care of her.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.800
Okay.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.520
Thank you, Master.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.080
Master Zhou, thank you.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.080
What for?

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.280
Don't you find it annoying to be pursued

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.600
by someone as persistent as a cockroach?

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.340
How about that?

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.420
You won't dare look down on me anymore, will you?

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.920
You're right.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.160
Actually, all along,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.040
the one making the Faustian bargain

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.960
was me.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.000
What's wrong?

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.170
This is the first time you've ever agreed with me.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.360
It feels strange.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.900
Was my attitude toward you

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.930
that bad before?

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.840
Be more confident.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.360
Drop the question mark.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.960
Aren't you afraid

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.770
that all your efforts might be in vain?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.520
If I don't try, wouldn't that be even more pointless?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.360
A guaranteed failure.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.960
So,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.410
hard work doesn't guarantee success,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.720
but without effort,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.640
there's definitely no hope.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.760
Even though I've fallen down,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.820
I've gained a crutch to help me up.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.820
And I even got a mentor now.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.330
If you're being naughty

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.320
and make your foot injury worse,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.840
affecting our filming schedule,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.760
I really can't guarantee

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.290
that Master Zhou will keep you as his student.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.600
Please don't worry, boss.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.360
I'll recover as soon as possible

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.800
and dedicate myself to the sacred cause of filmmaking.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.840
You know,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.600
you really are suited for acting.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.120
Your dramatic flair comes so naturally.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.840
It's just that your acting skills

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.240
aren't really that good.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.080
I know.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.120
I'll definitely study acting properly

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.280
and improve my skills.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.360
I'll also take good care of my foot

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.120
and be fully recovered before filming starts.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.720
Hello?

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.280
Take her to the hospital.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.280
So it's the centennial celebration.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.200
No wonder Sister Nishang's debut film

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.000
is being screened again in the academy's theater.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.720
By the way, Youyi,

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.560
didn't you graduate from this school too?

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.760
Are you going back for the celebration?

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.840
I don't have time for that.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.580
Youyi, I need to go out for something.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.360
I just learned your name today.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.240
But I've heard about you for a long time.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.620
The campus beauty.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.330
What else have you heard

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.960
about me?

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.560
That you're extremely beautiful

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.880
but a bit aloof.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.840
And you have many pursuers.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.650
Indeed, quite a few.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.520
But the one I fancy

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.160
is only you.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.520
Senior.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.920
I have something to do. I need to go.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.640
You two enjoy your meal, okay?

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.240
Okay, bye.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.839
Nishang, over here.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:05.599
I'm here.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.560
Alright. The movie has ended.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.680
Now, let's welcome our lead actress.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.280
Senior Ni Shang to the stage.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.680
Hello everyone. I'm actress Ni Shang.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.120
Senior Ni Shang, please share with us

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.400
how you felt while filming this movie.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.480
Actually, when I was filming this movie,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.480
I was just 18 years old.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.490
It was quite a coincidence.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.560
The plot of this movie

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.520
was very similar to my own experiences,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.250
so the entire filming process.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.960
I've let down my master

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.640
and all those who have supported me.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.840
I've failed them.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.440
I, Liu Mu, am no longer Master Zhou's disciple.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.880
I will never again use Master Zhou's name

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.200
to deceive anyone.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.720
I'm sorry.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.320
We were master and disciple once.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.280
Let it be.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.480
You once said,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.960
even those who journey together for a thousand miles

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.490
must eventually part ways.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.400
Master Zhou,

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.060
please don't take it too hard.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.650
Master Zhou,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.480
may I ask you for a favor?

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.480
You don't need to say it. I understand.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.880
Zheng Ying's foot injury hasn't healed yet.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.080
We'll start filming Ni Shang's scenes first,

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.160
and wait until her foot is completely healed before she joins the crew.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.840
Thank you for your understanding.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.970
I just don't want to owe you any favors.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.840
Besides,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.530
Zheng Ying is a good kid.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.120
You're a big star now.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.120
If you get photographed like this,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.180
it won't look good.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.800
Are you saying this as my senior,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.520
or as my ex-boyfriend?

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:56.960
Mr. Yu,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.500
it's getting late.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.600
I should go now.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.280
Mr. Cheng.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.200
Shen Yifan.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.320
You schemed against me and my company,

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.650
causing me huge losses.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.640
This isn't over between us.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.840
Mr. Cheng, are you now

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.700
reduced to drinking with people to secure funding?

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.610
That is quite pathetic.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.800
Sorry.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240
Let me tell you,

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.360
I'll not only make you pay,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.720
I'll also take Zheng Ying away from you.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.200
Well, that depends on whether

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.000
you actually have what it takes.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:08.880
Mr. Cheng,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.560
I heard

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.960
Zheng Ying injured her foot

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.280
and she's in the hospital now.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.880
What's that got to do with me?

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.960
Didn't you say you wanted to pursue her?

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.800
Chase her.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.160
I'm just giving her

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.640
a chance to get close to me.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.640
Pursuing her.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.690
But you did remind me of something.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.720
A wounded woman at times like this

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.680
needs more care and attention.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.280
Especially when this care

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.520
comes from me, whom she's been thinking about.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.280
Wu Yu.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.760
Could you please stop staring at me like that?

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.080
This is ridiculous.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.040
Mr. Shen said

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.400
to prevent you from hurting yourself again and delaying work,

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.200
so until your foot heals,

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.520
I'm specifically assigned to take care of

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.320
your foot.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.080
This one.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.080
What are you doing?

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.000
My foot

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.200
has its own thoughts.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.880
It says it's thirsty.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.200
My foot says

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.240
its owner wants some snacks.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.440
My foot says

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.920
this is too low. Could you adjust it higher?

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.400
Do you have any requests

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.260
that you could tell me all at once?

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.960
It's my foot that has requests, not me.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.300
That's enough.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.320
What's wrong?

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.040
Is it too hard for you?

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.820
But taking care of her is the task you assigned to me.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.160
I will complete it.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.480
Up.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:17.920
Pack.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.920
What are you doing here?

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.370
I know my appearance is surprising to you,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.250
but I suggest you start getting used to it now.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.580
Because I'll be showing up often.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.170
This place is too small.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.960
I need to get you a bigger one.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.660
What is all this stuff?

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.760
There's not even a bathroom.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.720
What is he doing here?

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.400
Why do you have all these things in your hospital room?

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.200
Get rid of it all.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.660
What are these things?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.920
He came after you.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.680
After me?

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.680
You mean to kill me, right?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.200
And you don't mind?

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.800
You're just going to stand there and watch?

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.780
Of course I won't just stand by and watch.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.840
That's more like it.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.890
Are we really going to ignore this?

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.300
Although she's my artist,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.320
I'm only responsible for her film and TV contracts.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.520
She'll definitely become more famous in the future.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.400
These situations will only increase, not decrease.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.860
Mr. Cheng poses no threat.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.220
Consider it practice for her.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.640
Nice one, Shen Yifan.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.970
So this is what you meant by not standing by and watching.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.360
Eat.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.620
Master Zhou says I need to strictly control my diet lately.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.880
No seafood allowed.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.520
No spicy food either.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.170
And nothing with high oil or salt content.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.360
These are all for you.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.920
Yu Youyi says I'm building my public image lately.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.400
No bags, no skincare products.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.720
No gifts over 2,000 yuan.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.520
I'm sorry.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.980
I can't accept your gifts.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.380
Light and refreshing.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.610
Affordable and practical.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.540
How about that?

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.000
Now you have no reason to refuse, right?

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.120
These two sitting together

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.720
look strangely harmonious.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.250
Let's go.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.800
What do you mean?

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.320
Sorry, Mr. Cheng,

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.360
I'm taking my person with me.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.120
Wu Yu,

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.080
go get the car.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.160
Your rescue method is quite direct.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.760
Your way of rejecting people

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.040
is quite tactful.
