00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.840
Wu Yu,

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.900
drive us there.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.880
Your way of helping people is quite direct.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.479
Your way of rejecting people

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.840
is quite tactful.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.850
I just didn't want to offend him again.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240
Are you afraid of him yourself

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.640
or do you think I would be?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.080
I certainly know

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.480
you wouldn't be afraid of him, Mr. Shen.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.240
But I was worried about causing you trouble.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.560
You'd have to deal with my problems again,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.800
and that would waste your time.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.660
Remember this:

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.640
if you don't want to do something,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.570
no one can force you to do anything.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:21.880
What's wrong?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.680
Nothing.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.920
I just think

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.440
you looked pretty cool when you said that.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.170
Stop flattering me.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.130
Go pack up. You're ready to be discharged.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.200
Great!

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.240
I can finally join the film crew.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.500
She left with someone else while I was still standing here.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.240
Mr. Cheng.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400
I checked her photos.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.720
Someone put them there by mistake.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.880
Do you think we might have misunderstood from the beginning?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.810
Misunderstood?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.040
I am Cheng Moyang.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.730
Would any woman not like me?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.200
Of course not.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.600
No woman could resist your charm.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.440
So what should we do next, Mr. Cheng?

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.680
She's about to join the production crew.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.720
Should we go after her?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.640
No. Pursuing aggressively isn't the right approach.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.760
We need to cool down after showing excessive enthusiasm.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.280
That way, she won't be able to handle the contrast.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.120
would come to me on their own.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.400
Alright, teacher.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.120
Thank you.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.040
Thanks.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.520
Assassin.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.720
You're an assassin now.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.240
Have you ever seen a real assassin making peace signs?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.079
Cold.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:49.920
Brooding.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.040
Don't you get it?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.760
Hello, Ms. Nishang.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480
What do you think?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.920
Should I go say hello to Nishang?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.360
I could mention I'm Yu Youyi's artist.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.320
Maybe she'll do me a favor

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.800
for your sake.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.160
You were schoolmates after all.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.520
Who told you that?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.720
Isn't it true?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.640
Or perhaps

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.060
you were more than just schoolmates?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.880
Let's go watch the award-winning actress perform.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.120
Why are you so excited?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.640
How can I not be excited?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Shen Yifan always says my acting is terrible.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.960
I want to see how a real award-winning actress performs.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.120
Why are you dawdling?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.050
I'm going ahead.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.640
Doctor, how is my husband?

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.180
I'm sorry. We did our best.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.200
No.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.960
Doctor, you have to save him. Please calm down.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.680
Doctor.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.320
Doctor!

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.120
Doctor, don't go!

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.480
Cut!

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.440
That's a wrap!

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.050
Why are you grabbing me?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.560
Let go!

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.240
All these scenes were done in one take.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.370
Her acting is absolutely incredible.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.760
Who are you people?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.640
Let me go now!

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.600
What I need is real tax planning.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.760
Look at what you've submitted.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.640
Don't waste our time.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.120
Hello?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.480
What's wrong?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.240
I finally realize

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.360
how bad my acting is.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.280
I'm glad to see

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.620
you've faced reality.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.880
Why don't you find me an acting coach?

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.920
Now?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.200
I've got my headphones on.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.240
You said

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.960
once I put on the headphones,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.690
you'd immediately take care of everything else.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.440
Are you

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.890
threatening me?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.960
You're the big boss. How dare I threaten you?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.760
This is just a test

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.680
of your almighty superpowers.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.360
Fine.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.280
Open the door.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.280
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.680
I'm the acting coach Mr. Shen invited.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.010
I've been here since your first day on set.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.040
Hello.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.120
Hi.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.920
Not bad, Mr. Shen.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.840
You're like my personal Doraemon.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.380
Thanks for appreciating my work.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.040
However,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.400
the cost will come out of your contract.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.080
Also,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.840
you'll need to double the snacks.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.320
Deal?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.000
Deal.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.520
Hey.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.170
Little boss.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.700
In ten minutes,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.240
notify the finance department to resume the meeting.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.120
You're all gentle breeze with your earpiece,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.000
but with me,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
you're like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.400
I...

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.080
I'm here to kill you.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.040
Cut!

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.799
That's it for today. The supporting actress's fight scene was good,

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.360
but her acting is a bit weak.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.679
Exactly.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.919
She can't keep up with Ms. Ni Shang at all.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.280
What kind of assassin

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.559
stutters when they're trying to kill someone?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.640
That's hilarious.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.680
Mr. Shen,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.920
can you help?

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.120
How can I help?

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.040
Are you the actor or am I?

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.520
Isn't your acting usually pretty good?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.560
I'll arrange a support vehicle.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.160
Okay.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.040
I'm sorry, Ms. Ni.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.880
Is your injury serious?

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.960
Do you need my help?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.800
That won't be necessary.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.440
Professional matters

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.300
should be left to professionals.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.220
Ms. Zheng Ying.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.320
The first part was quite good,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.580
but the latter part...

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.800
Your emotions didn't quite keep up.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.200
After you pushed Ms. Ni Shang down,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.000
you were completely led by her.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.680
You didn't show that assassin's decisiveness and ruthlessness.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.000
I understand ruthlessness,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.480
but how do I express decisiveness?

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.360
It means being resolute,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.530
not backing down, not hesitating.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.290
Understand?

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.850
Does this really need to be taught?

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.920
I'm sorry. I was too nervous just now.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.480
If you want to keep apologizing,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.100
you'd better say it to the whole team,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.810
because you're wasting everyone's time.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.280
Um,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.360
let's take a break,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.370
and get back in the zone.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.680
Looks like we'll be pulling an all-nighter again.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.280
One day is fine, but I'm afraid it'll be every day.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.920
Yeah.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.560
A work

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.400
is the result of everyone's efforts,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.530
both in front of and behind the camera.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.180
But what appears on screen

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.300
is only the actor themselves.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.380
Since you enjoy all the applause,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.040
you must be prepared to bear all the criticism.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.440
So I feel ashamed.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.400
You know, I'm trying hard to act,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.440
but why is there such a big gap

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.840
between me and Ms. Ni Shang?

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.640
Where exactly is the problem?

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.180
The problem lies precisely in

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.970
the fact that you're 'acting'.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.240
I'm acting?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.500
Can you teach me how to do this?

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.880
It's like this.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.520
I understand now.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.440
Today,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.000
I just followed what the teacher taught us

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.560
to break down the character,

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.880
but I only understood it superficially,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.240
without truly comprehending the character.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.700
But Ni Shang is different.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.770
Whether she's in front of the camera or behind it,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.800
she has already entered the character's inner world.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.840
When she faces the child actors,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.570
she's a kind and gentle mother.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.240
When facing me,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.320
she's the superior,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.760
unyielding wealthy family's young mistress.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.440
She lives as the character,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.160
so of course she doesn't need to act to be good.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.720
Right?

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.520
Yes.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.120
So let me think about how to do this.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.420
Learning by doing effect.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.290
What does that mean?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.200
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.320
Learning by doing.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.280
You want me to accumulate theory while filming,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480
and then the theory

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.720
will help improve my acting skills during filming.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.440
Is that right?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.370
That's correct.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.880
Are you sure you gave her my business card?

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.560
Yes.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.880
Not just your card.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.600
I even printed out your WeChat QR code

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.000
and gave it to her as well.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.880
That doesn't make sense.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.280
She should have been able to contact me.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.720
Mr. Cheng,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.680
could it be that

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.560
it's not that she couldn't contact you,

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.160
but that she doesn't want to?

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.080
Impossible.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.620
Where exactly is the problem?

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.160
in that production team, right?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:01.890
Zhang Zhang.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.120
Go arrange it. I'll visit the set.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.680
Okay.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.600
Don't move.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:25.980
You're up to

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.100
your tricks again.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.240
I'm the assassin now and you're my hostage.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.320
Behave yourself.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.360
Tell me.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.320
What were you doing

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.120
sneaking around Ni Shang's car?

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.800
Trying to poison her?

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.840
Reporting to the assassin.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.360
My staff injured someone,

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.080
so I'm bringing her some medicine.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.880
And apologizing while I'm at it.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.280
Is it that simple?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.640
What else?

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.040
Are you sure you're not using work

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.770
as an excuse to get close to her?

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.960
I'm starting to think that the gossip

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.480
Xiao Wan mentioned might be true.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.200
The way you look at Ni Shang is far from innocent.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.460
Brother Youyi.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.440
Why don't you tell me

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.520
what terrible things you did to her

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.920
so I can be prepared?

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.200
Nothing.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.160
I'm not joking around with you anymore. I have things to do.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.090
What kind of manager doesn't rehearse lines with me?

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.120
So unprofessional.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.600
Here comes someone professional.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.040
Don't you have someone

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.120
to trade with in your script?

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.320
Go rehearse with him.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.210
I'm leaving.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.360
Working hard is good.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.850
But don't forget our contract.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.200
Cutting off my snack supply would be a breach of contract.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.920
What do you mean by that, Mr. Shen?

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.960
Do you simply want snacks,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.920
or are you expressing dissatisfaction?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.400
Let's be straightforward.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.680
If you have something to say, just say it.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.120
There's no point in beating around the bush.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.640
You're taking this too seriously, Ms. Zheng.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.040
I just wanted to emphasize

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.400
the spirit of our contract.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.260
After all, this is the foundation

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.810
of our future cooperation.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.810
Don't you agree?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.280
Mr. Shen makes a good point.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.260
How about this?

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.020
I'd like to treat you to a casual meal.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.240
And we can discuss our future

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.240
80 billion cooperation project.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.120
80 billion?

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.640
If this domineering CEO act of yours

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.900
was taught by Ms. Wang,

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.080
she won't be getting her salary this month.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.600
I've never played a CEO before.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.120
Can't you just play along?

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.000
How can I play along with such exaggerated acting?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.400
See?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.240
You're still not in character.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240
An actor's conviction

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.500
destroyed by just a couple of my remarks.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.560
Mr. Cheng,

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.160
how did you find time to visit our film set?

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.760
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.840
He's here. He's coming this way.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.320
Aren't you supposed to be a cold-blooded assassin?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.360
What are you afraid of?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.560
Didn't you already say

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.200
my conviction isn't that strong?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.660
He clearly means trouble.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.320
Get lost!

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:07.980
Right away!

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.880
What if I can't control myself and make him angry again?

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.840
Good judgment.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040
Worthy of praise.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.920
But with me by your side,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.180
what are you afraid of?

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.200
So

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.760
impressive.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600
Mr. Shen, someone who values time so much,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.080
is actually visiting the film set?

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.320
What a surprise.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.680
You're the surprising one, Mr. Cheng.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.640
You come to visit but don't check on your own people,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.240
and instead come to see mine.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.360
What I do is none of your business.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.020
Why haven't you contacted me?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.360
Mr. Cheng.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.050
No need for your help, Mr. Shen.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.020
Mr. Cheng, do you really want me to reject you directly?

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.120
A good girl should know when to quit while she's ahead.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.320
Then I must be

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.080
a bad girl.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.520
You...

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.120
My special treatment for you

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.240
has its limits.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.640
There's a song lyric that says...

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.640
You're not me. How could you know my pain?

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.440
[Yiyan A66] You're not me. How could you know my pain?

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.480
You're not me.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.800
How would you know if I care about your special treatment?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.839
I'm not afraid of you.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.119
I don't want to manipulate your special treatment.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.119
I truly believe.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.599
Since we

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.250
owe each other nothing,

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.960
we should both maintain our dignity.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.040
Okay.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.730
You've successfully made me more interested in you.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.840
Do you know why I like you so much?

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.640
Last time at the hospital, can I choose not to know?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.320
But I do need to talk to you about something.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.080
Come with me.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.480
I know.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.020
Even though this has been your intention all along.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.720
But I need to tell you.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.600
I'm not the kind of man you think I am.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.930
You sent the qipao, didn't you?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.160
I misunderstood.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.770
I'm returning it to you now.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.400
Let me make something clear.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.080
What kind of man you are,

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.480
I've never imagined.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.880
And please don't define

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.440
what kind of woman I am.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.850
And I'm telling you,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.530
I'm not that kind of person.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.160
All right.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.600
I've said what I needed to say.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600
Please leave now.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.490
Was my rejection too direct this time?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.130
Class is about to start.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.480
Aren't you going?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.770
Then I'll quickly remove my makeup and go to class. Goodbye.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.640
Not bad.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.560
That feeling of waiting for an old flame,

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.160
you portrayed it quite well.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.080
It's so difficult.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.680
I feel that ever since my foster father sent my ex-boyfriend

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.640
to help me complete the mission,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.180
every scene has become really challenging.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.240
What should I do, sir?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.160
Half of tomorrow's scenes

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.920
are with my ex-boyfriend,

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.880
but the actor playing him hasn't joined the crew yet.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880
It's okay.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.200
You can find someone else to rehearse with you

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.930
to boost your confidence a bit.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.280
Mr. Shen, although you're an investor,

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.960
your superb acting skills are no less than those professionals.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.890
Get to the point.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.200
Please help me.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.570
Where did you run off to in the middle of the night?

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.000
Urgent notice!

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.840
The actor who was supposed to play the ex-boyfriend tomorrow

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.280
has something urgent come up.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.600
Tomorrow it's changed to you and Master Zhou

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.240
doing the breakup scene.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.330
Who are you looking for?

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.120
And who are you looking for?

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.280
I asked you first. You should answer me first, mister.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.970
Then who are you?

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.840
Ni Hao.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.560
Who introduces themselves in the middle of a conversation?

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.560
Anyway, I've said my part.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.960
Your turn now.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.920
Fine.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.720
My name is Yu Youyi.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.340
I'm here to find my artist.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.120
Artist? So you're a manager.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.080
You even know that?

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.240
My mom is an actress.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.840
A really good one.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.520
Is that so?

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.010
What's your mother's name?

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.570
I can't tell you.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.490
Let me take you to find your mom.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.280
It's not safe to be alone this late.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:25.810
Let's go.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.040
Which floor does your mom live on?

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.560
And which floor do you live on?

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.640
Which floor I live on?

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.640
I asked you first.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.490
Let's begin.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:44.960
Wait.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.320
You memorized it so quickly.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.320
I'm telling you, I need to get it right on the first try.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.000
Can I make a request?

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.880
As long as

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.040
you don't kill, commit arson, or sell children, go ahead.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.240
I don't know why,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.920
but I used to think life was just waiting to die.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.450
It was pretty meaningless,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.090
maybe because I hadn't met you yet.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.280
You're interesting, bright, and full of energy.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.970
You never lose hope even in the worst situations.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.680
I really want to have

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.260
a relationship with you that's more than just business partners.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.560
What kind of relationship?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.440
Would you...

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.120
would you be my...

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.080
Alright,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.800
I think you practiced really well.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.000
Your script revisions are excellent.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.800
Impressive.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.240
I'm going to bed now.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:22.920
Goodbye.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.280
Mr. Shen.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.440
The doctor said you must control your emotions at all times

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.440
and absolutely cannot get excited.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.090
The script has changed.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.240
So I practiced for nothing?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.800
I'm back.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.560
I'm sorry. I failed.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.640
Why is an assassin hiding?

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.680
Such a simple task and you failed.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.240
Why?

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:25.800
Speak.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.000
I...

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.200
I just felt she was too pitiful.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.560
I acted it wrong.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.840
What's going on?

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.700
Let's finish the scene first.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.570
The emotion an assassin should never have

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.320
is compassion.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.560
Was it when you first saw her?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.760
Or when she cooked a meal for you?

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.400
Sheng Jie, do you realize

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.840
some things can change in an instant?

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.520
Even the slightest change

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.640
can lead to severe consequences.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.440
All right.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.720
Did you prepare for this scene?

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.580
Why was your performance so poor?

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.280
I'm sorry, Master.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.800
I've embarrassed you.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.120
I'm not embarrassed.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.200
You're an actor too.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.370
If you perform poorly, you only embarrass yourself.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.000
Action scenes rely on skill.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.760
What do dramatic scenes rely on?

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.000
Acting ability!

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.840
Especially when you're working with an actress of Ni Shang's caliber.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.240
You can't be that much worse than her in your scenes together.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.480
Who should I act with then?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.280
Mr. Shen.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.320
Great!

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.800
Today's learning-by-doing guinea pig

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840
is going to be you.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.400
Mr. Shen.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.720
Why are you running away?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.140
Young Mr. Shen, what's wrong now?

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.600
Are you feeling unwell?

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.060
Young Mr. Shen.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.800
You seem a bit off.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.160
Do I?

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.160
I can't quite put my finger on it.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.400
Since yesterday,

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.250
you haven't been yourself.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.010
You want to stay away from that troublemaker, right?

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.650
Young Mr. Shen, I'm relieved that you think this way.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.480
What nonsense are you guessing?

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.440
Hello, Ms. Ni.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.680
Ms. Ni.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.120
Do you dislike me?

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.200
Yes.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.720
But...

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.200
Why?

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.420
You don't know the reason?

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.680
No, I don't.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.420
When you figure out why I dislike you,

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.360
you might be able to play this role well.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.880
You're avoiding me.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.840
No, I'm not.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.560
Why would I avoid you?

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.960
I don't know either.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.520
What reason would you have to avoid me?

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.440
But ever since we rehearsed that scene together,

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.300
you walk away whenever you see me.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.000
Are you...

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.370
Are you like Brother Youyi,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.280
not wanting to rehearse with me?

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:34.640
Yes.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.640
I'm not a professional actor.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.900
Stop asking me to practice with you. It's a waste of my time.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.720
Is it that simple?
