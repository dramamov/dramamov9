00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280
It's that simple.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.850
What did you expect?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.330
You don't have to rehearse with me.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.039
Then help me analyze

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.440
why Ni Shang dislikes me.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.180
Yu Youyi is the only connection between you two.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.200
She sees you with him every day.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.600
That's a possibility.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.080
No.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.000
She doesn't seem like the jealous type.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.800
There must be some other reason.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.040
I really like Ni Shang.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.800
I've seen almost all her movies.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.079
Don't you think Ni Shang is beautiful?

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.480
Well, I don't like her.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.800
She's so fake.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.720
Maybe she's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.800
very obedient to the investors.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.840
That's so true.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.920
She appears

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.560
cold and restrained.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.960
As an actress,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.040
being talked about is very common.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.040
I know.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.410
But I really can't take it anymore.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.200
Go ahead.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.400
Really?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.210
I'm here for you.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.840
You don't need to hold back anymore.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.079
I didn't say anything

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.720
folks.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.240
Are you discussing Ni Shang?

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.500
Who is this person?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.120
Who gave you the confidence

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.920
to do something to a film queen?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.680
Besides, she's a real person.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.800
Don't you have even

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.760
the basic respect for others?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.280
Excuse me, who are you?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.960
What's it to you if we're chatting here?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.360
Exactly.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.120
Get lost.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.360
Right, nothing better to do.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.480
What? Should we talk about you instead of her?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.600
If we're talking about status, you're certainly not as high as hers.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.800
But looks-wise, you're not bad either.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.520
I bet the price

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.040
wasn't cheap either.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.800
Isn't that right?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.360
If you can't speak properly, shut up.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.720
Otherwise, go back to your mother's womb

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.760
and learn how to be a decent human before coming out again.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.800
Who do you think you are?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.130
What do you mean 'who'? Stay on the ground.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.810
Let's go.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:42.960
Don't leave!

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200
Stop right there!

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.600
By means of degrading women

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.320
To show off your power.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.220
Don't you think it's beneath you?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.520
You're that gossip account that enjoys defaming others, right?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.720
Expect to hear from my lawyers.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.020
That slap of yours looked pretty fierce.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.120
No need to get friendly with me.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.160
We're not close.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.400
I wasn't trying to get friendly either.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.440
Look.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.040
Is that Ni Shang?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.960
An award-winning actress like you standing by the roadside.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.680
What if you cause a traffic jam?

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.280
Just making trouble for the traffic officers.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.159
Get her out of here quickly.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.960
Okay.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.159
I'll call Wu Yu

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.220
to come pick you up.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.580
Take care of yourself.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.400
Your artist is just like you,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.720
always eager to help others.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.170
As long as you don't think she's meddling.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.640
Well,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.960
That's nice.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.810
We finally have our own car.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.360
Do you know you've caused Mr. Shen big trouble again?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.120
Why did you have to meddle?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.840
Today's business

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.090
was something your boss Mr. Shen got involved in with me.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.930
Isn't that right, Mr. Shen?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.440
Yes.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.050
Ni Shang clearly dislikes you.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.540
Why did you still help her?

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.760
Because

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.080
I'm a woman too.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.000
Just because of that?

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.370
Although I'm not as famous as Ni Shang,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.200
as a female actress,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.360
I also constantly receive

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.840
malicious attacks.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.700
I really don't understand

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.720
why whenever people talk about actresses,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.240
they always discuss

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.400
their figures,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.840
looks and gossip.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.120
Ni Shang is already an award-winning actress.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.040
Her professional abilities

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.120
have already been professionally recognized.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.440
Why does she still have to be

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.300
judged like that by those people?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.480
It's not because she's an award-winning actress

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.740
that she shouldn't face such criticism.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.000
It's because no one

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.240
should face such accusations and disrespect.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.840
But those people just now

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.920
don't represent everyone.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.240
You won't lose confidence

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.440
because of what happened today, right?

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.400
Right.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.180
As long as we work hard enough,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.280
someday

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.120
prejudice may not disappear,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.560
but attitudes can change.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.040
Being with you,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.100
it seems like life becomes more vibrant.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.040
Recently, I

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.880
Mr. Cheng.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.040
You've had too much to drink.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.560
I'm in a good mood today.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.930
I'm going to drink myself to death.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.690
You sent the qipao, didn't you?

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760
I misunderstood.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.400
Let me make something clear to you now.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.930
I'm not that kind of person.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.560
Scene 25, take one. Action.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.480
Where is Guoguo?

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.000
Where have you hidden Guoguo?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.120
Please tell me.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.000
Say something!

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.360
Talk to me!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.600
He's where he should be.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.160
Where he belongs.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.680
Good. That's a wrap.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.500
It's approved.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.080
Shouldn't you be hitting me?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.440
Enough.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.240
I thought martial artists were all straightforward.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.600
Didn't you tell me not to get familiar with you?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.520
From what I know,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.240
you're not one to follow instructions.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.040
I clearly lost your child,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.760
you're angry with me,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.140
but why are you hitting yourself?

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.880
I am a mother.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.640
Protecting my child is my instinct.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.180
I failed to do that.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.840
So compared to you,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.160
I'm more angry at myself.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.880
But I didn't catch your reaction.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.560
Why did the director say that take was good?

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.720
We wanted your genuine reaction.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.500
Do you know why you can't play this role well?

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.000
I'm really sorry.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.640
Xiao Wan's schedule is full again.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.080
Okay.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.140
Alright, let's work together next time.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.000
Hey, bro.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.900
We've already agreed on this.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.840
Our Xiao Wan is a great actor and very cooperative.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.040
Please make sure to keep the role for us.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.000
You're just a kid without a father.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.240
Who says that? Of course I have a father.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.240
What's your father's name?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.720
Where is he?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.800
Why doesn't he come to see you?

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.680
What's wrong, baby?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.760
Dad, you're finally here!

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.960
Yes, daddy's here.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.920
See? My dad is here.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.760
Let's go.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.930
Not bad acting. You've got potential.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.580
You acted well too.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.560
No, no. I haven't been held by my father yet.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.520
Please act a little longer.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.560
As an actor,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.180
merely breaking down,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.410
understanding,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.840
and knowing your character

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.900
is far from enough.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.320
You must always keep all your senses open

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.280
to feel the energy from your fellow actors.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.160
No actor

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.210
can act while ignoring their scene partners.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.930
That day in the park,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.720
why did you help me

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.920
when you clearly dislike me?

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.160
I dislike you

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.560
because you always act so superior,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.560
looking down on everyone with that arrogant attitude.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.560
But I admit,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.720
with your talent and status,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.760
you have the right to be proud.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.480
However,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.820
when the day comes that I surpass you with my acting,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.500
I'll be even prouder than you.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.160
With your acting skills?

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.200
Nishang, let me tell you.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.040
Although I'm not your equal now,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.800
someday

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.680
I'll stand on the same award stage as you,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.440
and take

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.420
the Best Actress trophy from your hands.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.520
Let me tell you,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.220
I've never been anyone's murder weapon,

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.600
much less a disposable pawn.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.200
My life

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.440
will always remain in my own hands.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.520
Look at me.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.160
I'm the one who controls the rules of the game now.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.090
Are you going to work with me or not?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.640
Stop.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:53.920
One take.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.840
That's a wrap!

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.280
Thank you, director.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.000
Good work.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.480
I got it in one take.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.880
I saw that.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.440
Good job.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.360
Nishang.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.320
Should we be friends?

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.240
No.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.040
No?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.120
You're missing out on

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.580
the chance to be friends with a future award-winning actress.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.800
With your current acting skills,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.440
you want to be an award-winning actress?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.520
I doubt it.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.640
What's wrong with my acting?

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.320
I'm improving, aren't I?

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.200
You may look down on me now,

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.330
but someday I'll be out of your league.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.800
Let me tell you,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.360
acting with complete freedom

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.640
feels like this.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.760
It's amazing.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.840
Mr. Shen.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.160
I think she's

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.820
quite an interesting person.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.160
Interesting?

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.280
She seems

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.080
a bit naive,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.000
but actually understands life better than anyone.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.860
She's so full of energy every day.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.080
Just one person,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.760
yet she lights up the entire crew with her presence.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.480
Yes,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.520
how I wish I could stay close to that vibrant energy

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.780
and feel her vitality.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.330
Perhaps that way I could live a little longer.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.400
Last time you only told me the sixth floor

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.860
but didn't tell me which room you live in.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.690
Why are you still sleeping?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.400
Um,

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.080
this is not my child.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.020
Why are you explaining this to me?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.240
Baby.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.600
Baby.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.560
Come on, wake up.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.320
Get down.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.600
Come.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.760
This is my son.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.840
Thank you for bringing him back.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.120
Let's go home.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.640
Hello.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.200
Excuse me,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.760
where am I?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.720
Hello.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.160
Excuse me,

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.560
where am I?

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.000
This is, of course, where people

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.360
stay after they die.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.600
Are you asleep?

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.880
What's up?

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.600
Aren't we shooting the scene tomorrow

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.120
where I kill my father and then commit suicide?

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.080
I can't sleep because I'm memorizing my lines.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.440
What's wrong?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.000
Ni Shang was right.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.080
I need to fully immerse myself in this character

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.520
to perform it well.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.320
When I think about this character now,

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.560
it feels like I've actually lived

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.000
her brief life.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.680
Her life was indeed short.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.840
I feel so sad for her.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.520
Have you ever

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.760
felt tired of living?

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.440
Of course not.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.400
Though sometimes I feel like I can't go on,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.930
but I'm like a cockroach that can't be killed.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.360
But I'm trying to understand the character I'm playing.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.640
Perhaps

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.480
death was truly a release for her.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.840
Because a life where you kill people every day

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.480
with no future in sight is terrifying.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.300
What about you?

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.760
Is there anything you're afraid of?

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.570
I think a future that you can see

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.060
is even more frightening.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.520
He's fallen asleep.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.640
Mr. Shen.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.160
I'm finishing shooting tomorrow.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.090
This is my first time wrapping up as the lead actress.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.730
I want a bouquet of flowers.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.640
A super big one.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.860
Did you hear me?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.640
Starting from today,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.120
I'm going to use my real name again.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.000
And return to my true self.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.600
Everything is over.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.280
Everything

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.600
is starting all over again.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.480
Cut!

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.660
Ms. Zheng Ying has finished filming.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.480
Congratulations, Ms. Zheng.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.440
Thank you.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.720
Congratulations, Ms. Zheng Ying:

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.760
Good job.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.880
I knew it was

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.760
Why is it you?

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.280
Where's Shen Yifan?

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.650
I don't know.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.480
He called me saying he had an emergency and hung up.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.100
Why are you disappointed?

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.530
Hide that disappointed look on your face.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.000
These flowers are from my agent.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.920
They're beautiful.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.080
That's better.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.610
So what's the plan after I finish filming?

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.180
Get some good rest.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.200
Let's go.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.920
Holiday.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.120
I'm here!

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.660
Your delivery.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.440
Thank you.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.400
You have no idea how stupid I just was.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.240
[Confirm]

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.160
He's not responding to any of my messages.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.920
Is Shen Yifan playing hide and seek with me?

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.760
Hello? Is this Shen Yifan?

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.040
Mom.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.200
No.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.240
I'm not being impatient.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.200
It's like this person suddenly disappeared.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760
You know what?

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.520
After not seeing him for a few days,

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.240
I actually miss him a little.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.500
Why would I miss him for no reason?

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.820
Have I gotten used to being exploited by him?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.520
That's terrifying.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.960
Mr. Shen, please take a look.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.280
Mr. Shen is really getting proper rest.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.760
Are you satisfied now?

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.160
Mr. Shen,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.320
I've already helped you deceive the senior Mr. Shen.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.380
Isn't that enough?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.800
Your fainting really worried the senior Mr. Shen.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
He insisted that you must rest properly

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.400
and wouldn't let me give you your phone.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.920
Since you listen to him so well,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.780
why don't you just go work for him?

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.680
Have you arranged the company matters?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.040
According to your instructions,

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.320
Miss Zheng is currently on vacation.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.280
You may leave.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.200
Mr. Shen, you were right.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.000
He still took the phone away.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.130
I couldn't stop him.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.920
But don't worry.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.400
I only gave him the phone.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.720
Not the charger.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.240
What nonsense.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.320
I'm busy.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.080
This food of yours

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.880
looks absolutely terrible.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.600
During the break,

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.400
the acting class was meant to continue anyway.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.500
They say seeing the sunset brings good luck.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.040
I'm going on vacation.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.080
Hope you feel some of that good luck too.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.260
You can be discharged now.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.360
Good.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.200
Thank you.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320
I told you before,

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.080
you should stay at our family villa.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.280
It's perfect for you.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.200
I've spoken with the doctor.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.760
You already did that, didn't you?

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.600
Of course. How else could I let you use your phone

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.760
and allow you to leave the hospital?

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.200
The doctor said

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.080
although you fainted this time,

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.940
your condition hasn't worsened.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.320
He also said

it might be related to your improved mood lately.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.000
Do you think seeing you back in the country

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.460
would put me in a good mood?

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.740

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.400
If that's the case,

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.880

Saying it was love at first sight

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.140
was just an excuse to stay in the country.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.960

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.800
