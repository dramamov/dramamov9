00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.520
Go away!

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.520
Stay back!

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.759
Miss, open the door!

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:43.759
Miss, are you alright?

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.759
Miss, do you need help? Are you okay?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.160
Miss, please open the door.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.760
Open the door quickly, miss!

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.360
Zheng Ying, it's me.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.000
Shen Yifan.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.880
You finally came.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.940
What's wrong with you?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.940
What are you doing?

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.760
This is hilarious.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.440
So funny.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.680
Look at this.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.140
Why do you look familiar to me?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.920
You're trending.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.920
I never thought

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.560
my first trending topic after wrapping up filming

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.920
would be about this.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.640
It's so embarrassing.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.640
Doctor,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.640
why was I dancing outside and seeing zombies?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.720
What's going on?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.240
The dancing, we suspect it's related to your blood test results

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.240
showing homemade alcohol poisoning.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.500
As for seeing zombies,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.760
could it be because you've been

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.960
watching those kinds of movies lately?

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.300
I can't believe I drank fake alcohol.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.760
How embarrassing.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560
Why is he here?

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.280
He absolutely cannot know the real reason.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.960
Yes.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.400
I'll never eat carelessly again.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.240
It was poisonous mushrooms causing hallucinations.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.840
Thank you, doctor.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.720
Get some rest.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.000
I've explained everything

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.320
to her again as I told you.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.520
But you need to keep a closer eye on your girlfriend.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.240
Even with a high tolerance, she shouldn't drink like this.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.880
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.260
Such an embarrassing thing is trending now.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.920
He can't find out the reason why.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.320
Look at you.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.130
Why is there a mosquito flying in here?

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.280
I don't believe this.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.880
Finally caught you.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.080
Why is there a little bee now?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.800
The doctor said I still have toxins in my body.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.400
I'm prone to hallucinations

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.400
Don't know when I'll get better.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.240
Why is StellaLou here?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.400
Where's LinaBell?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.880
Let me ask you.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.720
What is this?

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.240
Isn't this a ladder?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.800
Why is there a ladder in the hospital room?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.060
How do you know you're in a hospital room?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.130
What hospital room?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.680
Isn't this the deep forest?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.320
How could this be?

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.400
Stop chasing me!

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.560
I'm home now.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.020
Mr. Shen, the discharge paperwork is ready.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.240
That act was exhausting.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.520
At least I managed to get through it.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.920
You think

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.440
you can fool our boss?

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.280
What a big mushroom!

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.600
Play with me, big mushroom.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.420
He must be dealing with the trending topics.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.840
He must be very angry.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.520
What are you standing there for?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.980
Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Shen properly.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320
That's it for now.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.720
What's wrong?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.240
Does it hurt a lot?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.240
What do you think?

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.600
I'm sorry.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.240
I didn't mean to. At that time, I...

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.560
So you were hallucinating then?

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.280
I wasn't hallucinating from eating poisonous mushrooms.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280
I lied to you.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.880
So?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.480
How do you plan to make it up to me?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.880
Double the snacks, no vacation.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.600
Controlled diet, not a drop of alcohol.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.960
Aren't these things that an actor

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.290
should be doing anyway?

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.680
Then tell me, what should I do for you to forgive me?

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.000
Does it hurt badly?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Wait here. I'll go get some medicine.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.080
No need.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.200
How can that be okay?

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200
Wait for me, I'll be back soon.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.040
No need.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.480
Why do you have a medical kit in your car?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.800
Because I have an artist who often films action scenes,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.530
so I keep these supplies handy.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.600
When I hit you,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.320
why didn't you dodge?

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.960
Why did you just take that punch?

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.160
Next time I'll dodge.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.799
Let's talk about today's shows.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.480
Not only are they painful to watch,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.210
but we actors are embarrassed to perform in them.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.920
Choosing scripts nowadays,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.930
it's not about picking between good and bad anymore.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.160
It's about jumping between bad and worse.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.000
You get it?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.600
So what if I don't like it?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.240
So what if I can't adapt?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.060
I try to adapt and act with my eyes closed.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.370
I'll talk to you later. Hanging up.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.360
Why is Brother Youyi here?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.800
So this is where film star Ni Shang

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.600
lives after returning to China.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.530
How did you get my phone number?

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.400
I found it in my mom's wallet.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.970
So what's the emergency you called about?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.880
I'm bored. I called you to play with me.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.920
Where's your mom?

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.000
What's wrong? Is she sick?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.600
After finishing each film,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.660
she always locks herself away like this for a long time.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.890
What are you looking at?

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.920
I...

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.520
Just enjoying the view outside.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.320
The weather is really nice today.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.400
Are you bored?

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.480
Why don't we have a meeting then?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.680
To discuss your next career move.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.680
What should I film next?

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.800
After finishing 'Duel of Beauties',

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.460
we've received many scripts.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.200
But the quality varies.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.760
I think

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.480
we should wait for something truly good rather than settle.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.480
Well, there must be

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.560
some quality scripts suitable for me, right?

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.360
There are,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.200
but they're all supporting roles.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.800
That doesn't fit with my plans for your career.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.000
You've been building up to something.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.120
You must have a good script

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.930
ready for me. Let me have it!

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.320
I don't have a script,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.970
but I do have a novel.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.160
I know this book.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.520
Famous author Liu Xiaomeng.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.300
More than a dozen of her works have been adapted for screen.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.960
This one has the best reviews.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.560
It even won a literary award.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.440
The content flows well and the story is clear.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440
The characters are fresh

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.040
and perfect for adaptation.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.920
So you mean

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.780
you want to develop this novel

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.120
for me to star in?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.520
Yes.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.890
But the current issue is

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.180
we need to find her.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.680
And

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.500
secure the rights.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.120
I, Cheng Moyang,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.520
could never be like this because of a woman.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.040
Please.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.160
Mr. Cheng,

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.330
long time no see.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.170
What are you doing here?

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.360
I came today

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.360
to tell you some good news

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.330
that I'm sure you'll praise me for.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.240
Get to the point.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.400
Mr. Cheng.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.840
I heard Shen Yifan is also in contact with this author.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.120
I also heard that Zheng Ying, in order to get these rights,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.080
agreed to star in this film

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.880
and turned down all other roles.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.480
If we can secure this,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.560
they'll see how powerful you are,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.080
and it would be the perfect revenge for you.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.570
As long as Cheng Moyang gets these rights,

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.880
then for the female lead,

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.080
who else could play it but me?

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.120
Get out.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.720
Get out.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:45.760
Come with me.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.400
Let go.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:46.920
Come with me.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.960
Let me go.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.480
You still take a long time to snap out of character after acting?

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.010
But hiding in your room isn't a good solution.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.560
Don't worry.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.290
I've told everyone to stay away. No one will come.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.560
Treat me as the character you played.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.090
After you hit me, you can say goodbye to it all.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.100
Aren't you curious

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.560
why I changed my name?

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.040
Is it because you wanted a different life?

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.240
Or are you desperate to distance yourself from your past?

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.840
Hello.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.700
I heard you want to buy the copyright for 'Drunken Jade Mountain'.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.240
Mr. Shen and his team have already approached the IP owners.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.680
You should stay out of it.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.080
Why?

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.200
You don't need to know the reason.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.000
In short,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.480
don't compete for any projects related to Shen Yifan.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.800
I know you're never satisfied with anything I do.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.640
So please stop interfering in my affairs from now on.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.240
Okay?

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.720
Your affairs?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.640
Have you ever done anything worthwhile in your entire life?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.770
You don't even know what you want to do.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.120
Long time no see, Mr. Shen.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.120
It seems Mr. Cheng is also after the copyright this time.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.640
Never mind what I'm after.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.720
I'm determined to get it anyway.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.370
I've heard your tough talk too many times, Mr. Cheng.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.800
I hope this time

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.640
you can actually deliver on your words.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.880
What do we do now?

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.200
Since Liu Xiaomang became a full-time writer,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.640
she has maintained a daily output of 10,000 words

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.440
without ever missing an update.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.520
And she rarely

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.080
appears in the public eye.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.610
This person's personality

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.410
is rather peculiar.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.440
So, are we just going back to the company like this?

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.420
Let's stay here for today.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.920
If we're lucky,

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.380
we might get to meet her in person.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.760
Stay here?

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.880
Isn't your home nearby?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.360
You can go home first.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.840
Have I been here before?

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.440
Why does it feel so familiar?

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.280
Mr. Cheng.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.920
I'm going back to my own home.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.320
Why are you following me?

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.280
I have plenty of time.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.220
I can go wherever I want. It's none of your business.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:20:59.840
Mr. Shen.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.560
What about you?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.280
Here I can communicate with you about work anytime.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.340
It saves time on work communication.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.240
The two bosses can rest here for now.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.320
Alright.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.240
Bringing back two at once.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.920
That's my daughter.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.360
Honey, I think the one across is better.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.600
He has a prosperous look,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.560
handsome and dashing.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.720
I prefer the gentle one on the sofa.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.760
He complements our daughter perfectly.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.920
You don't understand.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.120
The one across is better.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.440
You don't understand how good the one on the sofa is.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:43.960
You just don't get it.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.480
You,

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.000
tell us. Son, what do you think?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.130
Which one is better?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.280
I think both are good.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.400
Only children make choices.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.840
My sister is an adult now.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.240
She should have both.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.220
Wouldn't that be perfect?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.360
Hello, sir. I'm Cheng Moyang.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.360
From Yiping Sunshine Film Company.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.760
You must have heard of it?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.570
My goodness.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.760
So young and accomplished,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.920
with unlimited potential.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.850
You're too kind.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.160
Have some water.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.880
Thank you.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.840
Young man,

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.680
right now,

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.080
your financial situation isn't great,

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.240
but that's okay.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.360
Don't feel inferior or discouraged.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.680
Although these clothes...

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.280
With your current circumstances,

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.140
you're admittedly not quite worthy of my daughter.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.360
But that's fine.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.360
I know my daughter best.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.760
She's not someone who despises the poor and loves the rich.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.760
Rest assured.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.890
Just changed my clothes and

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.240
what's going on here?

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.530
Zheng Xiaohong,

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.680
you're quite something.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.920
Do you have any siblings?

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.680
What do your parents do?

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.200
It's okay, you can tell me.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.840
Mom.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.740
What are you asking all these questions for?

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.420
Already being protective, I see.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.920
That's good.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.960
Mom.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.180
Who are you looking at?

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.890
You like him, don't you?

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.000
Gossiping is a sin.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.130
Spreading rumors is shameful, madam.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.120
You're my daughter.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.000
Don't I know you well enough?

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.320
Don't say such things.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.160
He's just my investor.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.520
He's my boss, okay?

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.650
So what if he's an investor?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.320
Who says a boss can't become a husband?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.040
As long as you like him,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.400
you should be brave and go after him.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.800
Mom supports you.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.440
Silly child. Come here.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.280
Mom.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.480
Stop it, Mom.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.010
Hurry up.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.120
What are you doing?

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.520
I'm sorry about that.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.040
My mom is just like that.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.320
She's very nosy

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.180
and has no filter when she speaks.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.040
Don't take it personally.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.720
It's okay.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.970
I don't take it personally.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.120
That's good.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.180
Come with me to a place.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.520
Hello, welcome.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.080
Hi.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.160
Doctor.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.400
Young Mr. Shen suddenly wants to buy clothes.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.320
And he wants the most expensive and flashy ones.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.720
This isn't normal at all.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.520
Tell me.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.440
Can heart disease spread to brain cells?

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.400
Is Mr. Shen's condition getting worse?

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.330
Should we take him to the hospital?

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.240
Mr. Shen,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.160
why did you suddenly decide to buy clothes?

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.600
What's wrong?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.730
Am I not allowed to buy clothes?

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.920
What do you think of this outfit?

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.760
If you're buying clothes, just buy clothes.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.440
Why did you drag me along?

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.880
Well,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.400
doesn't your mother think I'm poor?

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.240
I want to buy something she'd approve of,

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.560
so she'll think her daughter

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.760
has a decent boss

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.480
and isn't so hard done by.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.440
I told you my mom was just talking nonsense.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.330
She was just treating you as...

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.520
As what?

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.040
I think that one looks good.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.320
Excuse me,

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.980
I'll take this one.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.650
Don't you want to try on such an expensive outfit?

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.080
Fine, I'll try it on.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.300
Miss, your boyfriend is so handsome.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.400
He doesn't know anyway.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.640
I'm just helping him ward off admirers.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:53.880
Right?

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.840
I also think my boyfriend is very handsome.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.200
How long have you been together?

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.760
About 10 years or so.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.000
We've known each other since childhood.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Childhood sweethearts.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.640
Green

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.280
plum

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:05.920
bamboo

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.240
Um...

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.680
It's perfect. Looks great.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.500
You didn't even look at it.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.040
How do you know it's suitable?

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.520
I...

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.040
Well...

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.320
It's fine.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.720
Let's take this one.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.160
Good thing he didn't come along.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.120
Why am I avoiding him?

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.280
Because you like him.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.740
Cast

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:46.800
Liu Shuai
