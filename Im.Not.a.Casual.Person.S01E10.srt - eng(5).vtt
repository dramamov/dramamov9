00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.880
Thanks.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.170
You mentioned last time that you have a child.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.139
I never heard about you getting married.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.600
Last time I went to your place,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.680
I didn't see

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.370
any photos of your husband.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.260
Let's play another round.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.320
You're awake.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.560
Hi, Ni.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.840
I have a question.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.720
Where is your father?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.960
I don't have a father.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.530
How old are you then?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.640
2345.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.000
5 years old.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.079
5 years old.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.040
Mr. Shen, are you afraid you can't compete with me?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.170
So you deliberately bought a new suit?

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.160
Mr. Cheng, this overconfidence of yours

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.490
When will you get it checked at a hospital?

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.450
I saw it first, give it to me.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.480
It's in my hands now.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.040
Let go. I saw it first.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.120
Let go.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.079
You let go first.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:44.600
Release it.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.800
You release it first.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.600
Dear Mom and Dad,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.400
on my way home from school today,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.040
I took advantage of my strength

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.840
and beat up a curly-haired kid.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280
Mom and Dad once told me...

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.200
Is that all?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.000
You must have more. Hand it over.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.640
Give it to me.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.680
You have to let me copy your homework today.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.040
Who are you? Mind your own business.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.840
So what? I'm going to interfere today.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.250
Guys, let's beat her up.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.040
Stop fighting, all of you!

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.360
What's going on here? Did you hear me?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.200
What's happening?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.520
No, what's going on here?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.120
The kids are just playing around.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.450
What happened to Yaozu?

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.960
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.800
Stop crying.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.480
Always causing trouble all day long.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.120
Just wait until I get you home.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.240
That's enough.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.520
Isn't it normal for kids to roughhouse?

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.600
Let's go home now.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.520
Come on, let's go home.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.580
Don't cry anymore.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080
What's wrong, sweetie?

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.140
Where are you hurt?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.680
Trying to trick Daddy, huh?

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.880
Little liar.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.410
Let's go.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.960
Be good, Yaozu. Don't cry.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.410
Where are your parents?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.480
Stop crying.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.850
No more tears, okay?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.080
Come, the dumplings are ready.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.720
Come on now.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.520
Come.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.760
Come.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.880
Kids, eat while they're hot.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.010
Eat your dumplings.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.920
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.800
Here.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.800
Mom, that's mine!

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.080
I haven't eaten yet.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.080
Isn't this big plate enough for you?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.480
Curly, save some for me!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.680
Don't be polite about this simple meal.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.520
Come, eat more.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.880
Here.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.800
Thank you, sir.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.080
The crispy meat at your doorstep is delicious.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.810
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.520
Eat.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.000
Here.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Thank you, ma'am.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.380
Zheng Yaozu said someone was looking for me.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.120
So it's you.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.320
Of course.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.960
What did you want to see me about?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.040
Don't you find this place familiar?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.960
Yes, it does feel familiar.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.620
Have you remembered anything

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.960
about the diary?

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.560
Today after school,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.720
I, the great hero, saw injustice,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.200
struck with mighty fists,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.960
and saved a skinny kid.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.000
Is this it?

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.640
What's your name?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.100
My name is Lei Feng.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920
I remember now.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.960
I knew you would remember me.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.720
Why would I remember you?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.960
You're too much, Zhengying.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.890
You're too much.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.800
Let me take a photo of you too.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.400
I don't like having my photo taken.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.520
Just do it.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.840
You may be skinny, but you're very good-looking.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.520
And let me tell you something.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.920
If you don't want to be bullied,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.720
you need to find a way to become stronger than them.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.760
Ready.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.840
I wonder where that skinny kid

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.040
is now.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.490
Zheng Xiaohong.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.810
What are you doing here?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.370
Why are you smiling?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.679
I always feel that when I'm with you,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.480
I can't help but be infected by your energy.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.600
Are you saying

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.919
that I have some kind of magic power?

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.880
Hmm.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.080
If this author is so hard to find,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.840
why are you so determined to buy the copyright?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.860
Don't you want to achieve something?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.600
Of course I do, but I want to rely on myself.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.520
If every film depends on you,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.480
then it's your achievement, not mine.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.680
I want achievements.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.250
You're the best candidate to help me succeed.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.050
Because you have something others don't -

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.180
a quality of resilience that grows stronger in adversity.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.920
My choosing you isn't so much about helping you,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.120
but rather about fulfilling myself through you.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.920
Your motivational speech is nice,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.240
but I feel your explanation is a bit far-fetched.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.100
Why not just admit you're into me?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.640
Whether you like him or not,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.480
you'll find out if you give it a try.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.640
Xiaohong, you're not a coward.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.600
Good evening.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.250
Where have you been so late?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.730
Where's Zheng Ying?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.600
Aren't you two together?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.640
No, don't move.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.120
Why are your lips so red and swollen?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.960
Were you two sneaking out

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.120
to eat delicious food without me?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.200
Really now.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.330
Don't move. I'm not finished talking.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.200
Hey!

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.120
So what if it's his birthday?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.440
My absence is the best gift I can give him.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.600
Are you sure he'll go?

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.010
I found out that Liu Xiaomeng hasn't gone out.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.440
She's been staying at home the whole time.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.280
Every morning there's a woman

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.120
who delivers some daily necessities to her.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.520
Come pick me up right now.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.800
Get the contract ready.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800
I'll be back soon.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.440
Shen Yifan.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.520
You're definitely going to lose this time.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.480
Was I being too impulsive?

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.960
But I've already kissed him. What else can I do now?

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.320
Does that make me a creep?

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:58.960
But I...

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.760
I only kiss someone I like.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.320
Hey.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.240
What's wrong?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.280
Youyi.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.240
If you realize you've made a mistake,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.280
how would you fix it?

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.840
I wonder if this girl installed cameras to monitor me.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.440
Since you know you were wrong,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.080
you must make amends, right?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.080
How do I make amends?

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.360
Seize every opportunity, understand?

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.960
Take the initiative, got it?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.760
Be persistent, understand?

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.760
Nothing can stop

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.820
my determination to be a good father.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.280
Take the initiative.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.900
Taking every opportunity

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.460
and being thick-skinned.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.400
Yingying.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.440
Mom.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.090
Why are you hiding here?

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.440
It's just a temporary separation.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
Why are you so sad?

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.400
Separation?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.160
You're not upset because Xiaocheng left,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.080
are you?

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.720
He left.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.880
So you're sad because Xiao Shen is leaving?

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.720
W-what?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.120
Who's leaving?

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.440
Shen Yifan?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.680
When?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.960
See? I knew it was about Xiao Shen.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.600
Sweetie, I think this matter

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.290
needs more consideration.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.280
No need to think about it.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.160
Don't listen to him.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.280
Don't think about it. Don't think about it.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.880
What's there to think about?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.880
I'm moving the project forward.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.340
Compare the two screenwriting teams first.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.680
I've already sent over the project proposal.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.410
Please take another look at it.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.930
I have something to say.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.850
I have something to say too.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.600
It was last night, that's right.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.360
Last night?

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.180
Wu Yu found out that Liu Xiaomeng was at home the whole time.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.780
You must know that.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.140
Let's focus on why we're here.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.200
To buy the rights.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.080
Exactly.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.530
So what's the most important thing right now?

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.320
Finding the author.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.420
Then what are you waiting for?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.760
Go now. Go now.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.500
I wonder if the nanny isn't coming today.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.200
That's impossible.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.680
According to what Mr. Shen has learned,

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.920
this nanny has been coming here

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.180
every day for three years, rain or shine.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.880
She must have been delayed by something.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.760
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.020
You really trust your Mr. Shen that much?

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.520
Of course.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.440
My Mr. Shen is never wrong.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.720
Do you know your Mr. Shen well?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.240
How many girlfriends has he had?

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.680
What's his type?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.160
Intellectual?

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.400
Cute?

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.400
Or glamorous?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.280
Why are you asking all this?

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.480
To pursue him, of course.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.000
What?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.040
Why are you getting so worked up?

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.570
It's not like I'm after you.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.240
Who says I'm worked up?

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.200
I'm warning you. Don't get any inappropriate ideas about him.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.280
How is that inappropriate?

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.240
He's single, I'm single.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.840
We're perfect for each other.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.200
What?

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.320
Being single doesn't make you compatible.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.320
My young master,

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.680
the second son of the Shen family,

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.010
investment genius and walking money god,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.440
and then look at you.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.370
How are you compatible?

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.040
In matters of love,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.920
talking about status and wealth is shallow.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.160
Forget status and wealth.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.680
Let's talk about his ideal type.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.920
My Mr. Shen prefers someone

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.560
intellectual, elegant, wise, and knowledgeable,

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.020
someone who can discuss economics with him.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.240
Can you do that?

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.160
I'm an actress.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.480
I can play any type.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.040
Your Mr. Shen? I've set my sights on him.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.040
You!

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.640
Thank you for your help.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:09.599
Ma'am,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.520
this fall is quite serious.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.119
You should go to the hospital to get it checked.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:14.839
Okay.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.609
I'll go this afternoon.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.359
I'm here now.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.579
Please give me the groceries.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.319
Let us help you carry these things inside.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.640
To be honest,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.720
this is my employer's house.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.520
I can't invite you in.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.880
That's fine.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.320
Thank you.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.880
We'll be going then.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.880
Okay,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.520
thank you so much.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.320
How could I forget my keys?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.960
Meng Meng?

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.440
Meng Meng?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.520
It's me.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.680
I forgot my keys.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.800
Hello.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.760
Are you the writer Liu Xiaomeng?

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.880
Auntie, did you bring these people here?

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.760
No, no.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.000
I was just outside.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.760
Yes.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.600
We just noticed that you have difficulty walking.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.040
So you're here to buy the copyright.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.300
Don't waste your time.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.300
I won't sell it.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.000
You should leave now.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Please go.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.000
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.000
I failed to find out

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.880
the crucial information about her being paralyzed for three years,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.240
and rushed to visit her, messing everything up.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.580
Should we look for another intellectual property?

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.080
No need.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.000
At least now

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.080
we've met her in person.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.600
But we've only left a bad impression.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.320
Precisely because of that bad impression,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.050
we need to visit and apologize.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.940
I believe you can do it.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.120
You always have this energy that people can't refuse.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.840
So,

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.820
make the most of tomorrow's opportunity

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.440
and become

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.600
her only choice.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.840
Does this energy work on you too?

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.320
Let's go back.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.800
Tomorrow, we continue the mission.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.440
Why aren't you going back to rest?

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.720
You go first.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.400
I need to discuss with him

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.480
about tomorrow's operation.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.200
Me too.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.680
First come, first served.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.560
Are you two elementary school kids?

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:04.960
Wu Yu,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.130
you go first.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.040
Shen, Boss Shen.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.500
Am I your assistant picked from a trash heap?

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.000
Bye-bye to you.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.920
Any other questions?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.680
You can ask.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.960
Actually,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.400
it's nothing important.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.680
I just read a few economics books recently.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.880
There are some concepts I don't quite understand.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.610
I wanted to ask for your advice.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.720
Go ahead.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.800
Mr. Shen often says

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.530
economics can explain everything in this world.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.640
I wonder in your eyes,

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.120
how does economics explain love?

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.680
The meaning of love

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.240
is finding the most suitable person for you

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.340
and spending the rest of your life together.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.920
The purpose of economics

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.700
is to achieve optimal resource allocation.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.840
So from this perspective,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
the two do have something in common.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.160
I see.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.320
So, Mr. Shen,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.640
what kind of person

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.200
would be the optimal match

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.120
for you in terms of love?

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.520
What do you think?

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.920
How about me?

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.800
Last night,

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.460
Zheng Ying.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.560
I will have to leave eventually.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.160
And it might happen soon.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.160
I have one and only one goal:

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.000
to make you a star.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.660
This opportunity is crucial for you.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.520
I hope you can stay focused.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.960
Now go get some rest.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.200
Please leave.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.560
Shen Yifan,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.560
don't you have any feelings for me at all?

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.360
Please leave.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.480
Mr. Shen, you need to control yourself.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.040
Go to bed. Zheng Ying has inappropriate intentions toward you.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.800
Go to bed.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.760
The doctor said you can't get excited or overthink things.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.760
You absolutely cannot faint again.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.690
If I can't give you lasting happiness,

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.480
isn't it better to let go sooner?

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.600
That would be a mercy for you.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.280
Don't mention sensitive topics.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.480
Don't look around.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.080
Stay quiet and be discreet.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.760
Got it?

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.280
I'm not an idiot.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.960
Hello, sir.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.800
Excuse me, do you know...

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.920
I'm just a neighbor.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.850
Just helping to take out the trash.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.400
What a good neighbor.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.240
Great author,

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.600
are you home?

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.920
I heard from the agent that

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.040
the lady needs to rest these days due to a leg injury,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:32.760
so right now

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.960
she's probably home alone.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.680
She's home alone?

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.850
Then she'll be the one opening the door for us.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.560
Uncle.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.840
Um, I heard that

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.200
the CEO Wang from Boya Creative Publishing

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.800
is going to attend

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.600
Grandfather's birthday party?

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.520
Could you introduce me to him?

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.680
But just...

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:55.880
Yes,

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.280
keep it secret from Grandfather,

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.600
absolutely confidential.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.120
You know I don't like using his connections.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:04.920
Okay.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.570
I'll wait for your news, Uncle.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.330
Goodbye.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.240
Mr. Cheng,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.920
Shen Yifan has already met with author Liu Xiaomang

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.760
in person.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.020
No good. It's too late.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.960
Prepare a gift for me.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.640
I need to go there personally.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.440
Okay.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.240
Great author,

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.040
want some barbecue?

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.520
Mang Mang,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.810
would you like some fried chicken?

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.480
Do you really have to be like this?

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.640
Acting like a desperate simp?

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.920
It's embarrassing.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.680
You're so naive, young man.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680
Mengmeng.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.680
Want some rice noodles?

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.760
With a fried egg?

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.120
Hello.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.540
Hello, this is property management.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.800
We've received complaints

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.720
that there's loud arguing in your apartment,

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.760
the noise has exceeded 70 decibels,

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.960
which is disturbing the neighbors.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.400
Is there any problem here?

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.240
I've already said I...

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.200
Excuse me, may I use your bathroom?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.160
She might have an upset stomach.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.840
We came here

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.880
mainly to apologize for yesterday's rudeness.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.880
We hope you...

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.840
I've said I won't sell the rights.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.080
The female lead in my novel is perfect.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.160
No one can do her justice.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.080
I won't ruin her for a few bucks.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.040
Yes.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.280
The female lead in your work is indeed perfect.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.520
But an actor's greatest charm

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.800
is their adaptability.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.200
Like the person just now.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.200
She wants to play my female lead?

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.040
Are you kidding me?

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.160
She knows martial arts just like your character,

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.280
and she's loyal and knows boundaries.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.680
I think she fits the role in many ways.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.480
Mengmeng.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.800
You're out of toilet paper,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.200
could you bring me a roll?

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.600
Knows boundaries...

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:00.920
Mengmeng.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.640
Let me introduce myself.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.840
My name is Zheng Ying.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.760
I'm an actress.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.520
You type so fast!

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.180
No wonder you're a writer.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.000
These decorations are so unique.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.640
All mountains.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.280
You have so many books.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.600
Must be thousands of them.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.320
You could open a library.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.680
Martial arts novels.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.400
Comics too.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.120
We have similar interests.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.880
You actually have volume 10 of this comic!

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.640
I couldn't find it anywhere.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.760
Let me take a look.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.280
We should leave now.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.880
Let's not disturb the writer's work.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.210
You go ahead. I haven't finished reading.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.360
You...

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.200
I...

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.060
I'll wait for you outside.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.680
You're Zheng Ying, right?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.280
Let me tell you something.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.960
You are not the perfect lead I have in mind.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.200
Don't waste your time here.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.360
Please immediately...

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.040
leave.
