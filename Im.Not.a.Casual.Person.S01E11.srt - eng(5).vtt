00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.440
You're Zheng Ying, right?

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.960
Let me tell you something.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.800
You're not the perfect leading lady I had in mind.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.000
Don't waste your time here.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.800
Please leave

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.960
immediately.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.320
I know.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.320
But I have orders from my boss.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.560
I have no choice.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.600
I'm just an employee.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.320
I know my behavior is inappropriate.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.540
I don't feel good about it either.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.500
Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.479
No need.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.280
Just leave.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.200
Are you sure?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.040
I feel guilty.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.000
And if I leave right now,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.520
my boss will...

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.560
Can I go down later?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.160
In return,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.760
I can help you clean up.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.560
After all, your housekeeper won't be back

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.620
for a few more days.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.360
No need.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.290
Just stay quiet for a while.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.079
Really?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.800
Thank you so much.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.120
However,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.079
I'll definitely stay quiet while cleaning.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600
Don't feel burdened.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.800
I'm sincerely grateful.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.600
Meng Meng.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.240
Do you have any detergent?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.700
Could you find some for me?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.760
Meng Meng.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.200
Do you have any garbage bags?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.360
Hand me one, please.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.440
Meng Meng.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.600
Could you come over and organize these papers?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.200
I'm afraid I'll mess them up.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.440
Meng Meng, come help me quickly.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.920
I can't hold on anymore.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200
Liu Xiaomeng.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.040
Liu Xiaomeng.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.420
Is this what you call being quiet?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.440
And do you think in my condition,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.240
I can help you?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.360
What's inconvenient about it?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.840
Don't think that just because you're in a wheelchair,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.760
you don't have to do anything, okay?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.800
The only difference between you and me is

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.660
I'm standing and you're sitting.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.440
But...

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.520
You still have to do your part.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.360
Here, take this.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.040
Oh, my back!

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.240
What's in here? It's so heavy.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.640
I...

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.200
Can I open it and take a look?

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.040
How about a trade?

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.440
I made all of these myself.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.600
Everyone who's tried them says they're good.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600
How unique!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.280
Oh my goodness!

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.520
I can't believe you do such extreme

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.000
and challenging sports.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.040
That's so cool!

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.560
I thought my athletic abilities

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.680
were unmatched.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.900
Turns out you're just as impressive.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.440
But now I

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.820
can't do anything.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.980
Even standing up and walking is a luxury I can't afford.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.200
You're not helpless.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.960
You've just changed battlegrounds to continue your fight.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.820
You have no idea

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.440
how many people love reading your writing.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
Looking at these photos and medals,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.720
I finally understand

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.000
why the female characters in your stories

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.320
are so brave,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.400
passionate,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.480
and can all leap across rooftops.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.440
Because their mother

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.570
is exactly that kind of person.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.760
Have you read

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.040
all those novels?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.440
Not just read them,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.280
I can recite them by heart, okay?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.880
The female lead is absolutely the ultimate heroine.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.360
Brave and clever, able to adapt to any situation.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.400
And her ultimate move.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.940
Let me show you.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.160
Before we went in, I repeatedly warned her

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.600
not to step on the writer's landmines.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.700
But what did she do?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.050
She went crazy dancing as soon as we got in.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.300
Why did you do that?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.800
I just wanted to get closer to him.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.440
That's suicidal bonding!

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.940
I don't know what's wrong with me.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.720
My mind is all confused.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.440
I seem to lack motivation.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800
What kind of motivation do you lack?

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.159
If I had motivation,

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.560
I'm sure I could solve everything.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.370
Are you sure?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.680
I'm sure.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.720
Do you want to hear it?

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.040
Go ahead.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.040
Meng Meng asked me to write a character analysis of the female lead

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.240
and if it's suitable, she's willing to sell us the copyright.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.480
How did you manage that?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.040
Anyone who has read her novels would know

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.360
that her female protagonists are always very strong-willed

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.800
and adventurous.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.200
This precisely indicates

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.080
that the author herself is that kind of person.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.940
Think about it,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.400
would such a proud person

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.500
ever allow others to look down on her?

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.200
So,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.320
the more cautious you are around her,

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.080
the more she feels you're pitying her

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.040
and reminding her that she's disabled.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.280
So you deliberately acted that way when you entered

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.960
just to make her feel you weren't pitying her?

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.920
Exactly.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.280
What she needs most isn't sympathy,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.920
but equal treatment.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.159
Well done.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400
Power delivered.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680
Let's go on a date.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.480
Speak properly.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.200
Stop being deliberately cute.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.260
Shen Yifan, your hand just trembled.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.080
Don't you dare flirt with our boss Shen, understand?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.280
Stop fooling around.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.460
Zheng Ying did well today.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.680
Keep up the good work tomorrow.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.280
Try to secure the copyright.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.039
Thank you.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.039
Are you going to reward me with a date?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.080
Okay, I accept.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.000
No.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.679
Mr. Shen,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.919
admitting you like me

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.720
isn't something to be shy about.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.320
Shen Yifan,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.880
I can hear your heart beating for me.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.340
I need to use the restroom.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.680
Shen Yifan,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.200
won't you admit it?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.120
Turn to the first page.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.560
Please turn to page 13.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.760
13 is my lucky number.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.840
Remember that.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.240
You fool, just admit it.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.160
You have feelings for me.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.120
Mr. Shen, what are you smiling about?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.050
Go back to sleep.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.460
Every day we're alive,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.780
we should enjoy it to the fullest.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.370
I can do that too.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.080
Really?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.820
Zheng Xiaohong

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.760
The publishing industry is in a slump right now.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.620
I understand your difficulties.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960
However,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.040
I currently

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.700
have no plans to enter the publishing industry.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.560
So,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.290
I'm afraid I can't help you.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.960
We can collaborate in the future when there's an opportunity.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.880
Absolutely.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.520
Mr. Wang,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.720
hello.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.840
Hello.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.260
I have some ideas about entering the publishing industry.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.000
Liu Xiaomeng is a writer signed with your company,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.520
right?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.760
So the copyright for 'Drunken Jade Mountain'

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.090
should also be with you.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.320
I see.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.200
Then I need to talk with the editor

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.600
responsible for novels.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.000
As long as we can work things out with Liu Xiaomeng,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.040
we can establish

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.500
a long-term stable strategic partnership.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.920
No problem, Mr. Cheng.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.960
Wait for my news.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.760
Mr. Cheng, I'll be leaving now.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.960
I'll visit again another day.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.280
Alright, take care.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.730
Take care, Mr. Wang.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.720
Stop right there!

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.920
Did you consult me before buying these rights?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.480
When you abandoned my mother,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.640
did you consult me?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.820
Is this your character analysis?

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.400
I know my understanding isn't profound enough.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.760
I'll continue to study where I'm wrong.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.320
This is the proposal written by your boss.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:18.800
Yes.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.600
My understanding of the characters might not be perfect.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.720
But his proposal

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.120
is absolutely flawless.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.000
I can guarantee it with my integrity.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.860
You have no idea how amazing he is.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.080
In the investment world,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.080
he's practically a legend.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.280
You like him.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.920
Is it that obvious?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.280
It's written all over your face.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.280
Then why does he act like nothing's happening?

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.480
Your brave approach to love

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.880
is quite similar to the female lead Shanlan.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.720
Indeed.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.800
We're both the type who love and hate boldly,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.130
carefree women who live without regrets.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.760
But she's genuinely carefree.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.680
You're just thick-skinned.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200
So,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.160
how did you create

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.290
this other version of me in your story?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.000
Could you

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.400
get my vitamins for me?

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.920
They're in the next room.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:08.680
Sure.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.100
So you know about this nice neighbor.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.440
You don't happen to like him, do you?

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.480
Don't deny it.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.240
It's written all over your face.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.040
Yes,

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.120
I do like him.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.440
I even spy on him.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.200
What's the point of just looking?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.680
You can see but not touch.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.400
I...

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.720
What are you doing?

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.760
You created

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.880
such a powerful female lead like Shanlan.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.800
Be brave.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.280
Ask him out.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.160
Ask him out for what?

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.560
A date, of course.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.600
What else could it be?

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.880
Your character understanding is inadequate.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.520
Go back.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.040
Wait, don't.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.560
How about we make a deal?

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.960
What do you have to offer?

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.560
A man.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.680
Good Chinese Neighbor.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.250
Would you like to have a meal together?

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.880
Tomorrow at 11,

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.680
Xinghu Plaza, Pan Art Garden Restaurant.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.080
I think we'd better not.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.680
They've been throwing garbage at your place for so long,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.520
isn't it normal to treat them to a meal?

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.040
I...

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.320
I could just buy some gifts for them instead.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.880
Is the point to thank them?

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.160
The point is to get closer under the pretext of gratitude.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.960
No way.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.480
I still need to take it back.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.760
What are you afraid of?

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.440
Show Shanlan's confidence and courage!

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.680
See you there.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.520
Look,

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.120
he wants to see you too.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.000
But maybe after meeting me,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.920
he won't even want to take out the trash for me anymore.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
Are you very concerned about your condition?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.280
It's just reality.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.640
I can't walk.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.890
I can't take care of myself.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.560
Someone like me,

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.340
who would accept that?

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.240
What about you?

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.160
Have you accepted yourself?

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.480
You haven't left

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.040
this room for three years.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:23.960
Meng Meng.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.520
Why can't you be like Shanlan,

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.160
not controlled by emotions,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.440
living freely?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.880
Think about your courage and determination when rock climbing.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.540
Challenging yourself isn't unfamiliar to you.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.160
Go.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.240
Not for others,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.000
but just

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.480
to help yourself stand up again.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.960
You're right.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.060
I'm doing this for myself.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.240
The roads have become wider,

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.200
there are more shops,

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.160
everything has changed.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.720
Yes,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.520
everything is moving forward.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.960
Only I

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.850
have stayed in the same place for too long.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.240
It's not too late to catch up now.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.250
Not too late.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.600
Thank you, Zhengying.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.130
If you want to thank someone, thank yourself.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.040
Hello.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.480
My dog got out earlier

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.880
and tore your garbage bag.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.740
I cleaned it up.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:46.840
Here.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.420
Miss Ni, are you getting rid of all these things?

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.970
Throw them away.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.600
Mr. Shen, are you sure

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.530
Zheng Ying will play the lead role?

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.520
You can rest assured about that.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.440
Long time no see.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.080
That's basically the situation.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.960
Mr. Cheng is now our company's

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.040
second largest shareholder.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.040
And because we previously signed

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.960
a right of first refusal agreement.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.720
So,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.320
if you as the author want to sell

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.240
the rights to 'Drunken Jade Mountain',

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.240
you must offer it to Mr. Cheng first.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.880
Sigh.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.440
This isn't good news.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.720
That girl is Mangmang's editor.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.400
Mr. Shen.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.240
I'm sorry,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.980
but I've already secured the rights.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.490
Do you two have more to discuss?

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.440
I'll leave you to it then.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.930
Until we meet again.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.880
Mr. Shen,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.480
I'd like to speak with Zheng Ying alone.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.000
Alright.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.960
I'm sorry,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.680
they have the first right to handle my work.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.760
It's okay.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.620
This isn't your fault.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720
Even if I can't play your female lead,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.320
I'll still support you.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.120
No.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.650
You are the female lead.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.200
I'm sorry,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.840
I only accept Zheng Ying as the female lead.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.200
If it's someone else,

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.660
I'd rather not sell it.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.800
It's clearly stated in this contract

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.520
that I have

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.010
the right to refuse.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.880
Looks like we think alike.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160
In my eyes,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.930
besides Zheng Ying,

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.610
no one else can play my female lead.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.380
Did he really say that?

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.620
This person's behavior is getting stranger and stranger.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.720
He's just

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.520
another person with words carved on his forehead.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.880
Forget it.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.760
Just focus on the one you like.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.320
So is there any progress with your nice neighbor?

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.360
No matter what happens in the future,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.200
I think I'll face it with acceptance.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.130
Because courage

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.210
doesn't leave room for regret.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.820
I sincerely wish you well.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.640
Be brave to pursue what you love,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.840
and leave no regrets.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.200
I will.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.330
Didn't expect to see you again so soon.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.210
What do you mean by that?

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.680
If I remember correctly,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.540
Mr. Cheng's capital chain

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.290
should still be broken, right?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.520
Such a large intellectual property,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.720
can you handle it all?

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.250
Do you have channels for overseas distribution?

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.840
That may be true,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.480
but I have many potential partners.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.440
I don't necessarily have to choose you, Shen Yifan.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.700
Our goals are aligned.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.810
Why can't we work together?

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720
Synergy effect.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.400
You must have heard of it, Mr. Cheng?

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.800
I'm sorry,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.600
I'm not as knowledgeable as you.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.520
One plus one is greater than two.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.180
You should at least know what that means, right?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.040
If you really want this project to succeed,

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.960
just wait here.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.650
Wu Yu will bring the contract soon.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.280
No way.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.060
I insist on waiting in the car.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.640
He actually agreed to cooperate.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.400
It's like he's become a completely different person.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.640
Unbelievable.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.280
What transformation?

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.090
It's just driven by profit.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.440
That makes sense.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.560
But

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.420
we've secured the copyright now,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.840
shouldn't we celebrate?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.330
I'll arrange it.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.520
Let me do it.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.160
Wu Yu, pull over up ahead.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.720
I'll set up the time and place

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.320
and text you all the details.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.440
Since we're celebrating, let's put it on the company account.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.900
Remember to get a receipt.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.800
How generous!

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.680
What is she up to?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.240
What's wrong?

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.080
Mr. Shen, look.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.290
A candlelit dinner for two.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.940
Is she trying to confess her feelings to you?

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.400
Are you rewarding me with a date?

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.640
Fine, I accept.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:46.640
No.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.080
Mr. Shen,

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.320
admitting you like me

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.120
isn't something to be shy about.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.720
Shen Yifan,

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.960
I can hear your heart beating for me.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280
Mr. Shen,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.520
the doctor said you need to keep your emotions stable.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.120
If you'll have to leave eventually,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.780
why bother flirting with her?

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.540
Didn't you say that yourself?

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.560
If you can't even flirt with her,

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.400
why torment yourself?

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.040
Don't you want more time with her,

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.320
and with us too?

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.880
Your condition is very unstable.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.520
You should avoid emotional fluctuations

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.920
to prevent your condition from worsening.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.800
'Drunken Jade Mountain' project needs to move forward immediately.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.080

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.600

Okay.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.200
Mr. Shen.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.020
We can head to the airport now.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.220
Do you still need this?

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.260
No, I don't.
