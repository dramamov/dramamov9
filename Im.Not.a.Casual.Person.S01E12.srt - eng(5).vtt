00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.450
I will have to leave eventually

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.079
and it might be soon.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.120
I have one and only one goal:

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.320
to make you famous.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.040
This opportunity is very important for you.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.970
I hope you can stay focused enough.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.960
Now go get some rest.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.840
Aren't you afraid

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.920
that all your efforts will be in vain?

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.200
Not trying would be an even bigger waste.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.680
So,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.010
hard work doesn't guarantee success,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.440
but without effort,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.360
there's definitely no hope.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.130
It's not that you don't like me.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.340
You're afraid to like me, aren't you?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.760
Why?

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.560
Didn't you see my messages?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.600
Didn't you hear my calls?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.600
Why didn't you show up?

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:53.560
Hello?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.320
Hello?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.720
Shen Yifan.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.320
Do you like me or not?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.400
This feels so real.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.480
So it's not a dream.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.440
You're drunk.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.080
Get some rest.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.720
Trying to run away?

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.320
Not a chance.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.560
Listen to me.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.680
I have something to tell you.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.640
What do you want to say?

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.960
I like you.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.240
Didn't I tell you-

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.400
I said I like you.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.240
Zheng Ying.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.400
I said I like you.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.200
You're drunk.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.720
Get some rest.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.600
You're right.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.760
I'm afraid to like you.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
You're so brave.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.560
I want to be brave too.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640
Just this once.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.960
But someone who's far from hope

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.560
and close to death

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.600
has no right to get close to

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.800
someone who loves life as much as you do.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.040
It's the doctor.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.680
I know.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.280
Time to increase my medication.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.210
Get me some wine.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.570
Bring me a drink.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.080
Mr. Cheng,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.200
why are you drinking alone here?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.530
What are you doing here?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.400
Mr. Cheng,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.600
I heard that you've purchased the rights

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.760
to 'Drunken Jade Mountain.'

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.159
Why didn't you inform me?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.730
Why should I inform you?

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:54.760
Mr. Cheng,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.159
don't you think

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:58.090
I'd be perfect for the female lead?

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.370
I don't think so.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.530
Besides, we've already cast the female lead.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.360
Who is it?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.040
Zheng Ying.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.080
No way!

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.120
Why?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.880
Didn't you promise me the role?

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.200
Who promised you that?

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.440
I never considered you

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.880
for this project at all.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.160
Zheng Ying, you just wait and see.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.080
I couldn't have taken advantage of him while drunk, could I?

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.540
Don't panic, don't panic.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.640
This is his home. It's normal to find his clothes here.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
No way.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.120
Could something really have happened between us?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.960
Whether you've woken up or sobered up,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.890
come out and eat.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.320
I'm awake now,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.080
wearing his clothes,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.960
eating the food he prepared.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.160
This scene...

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.640
why does it feel like we're married?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.600
Why be shy at this point?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.320
Seriously.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.000
Don't worry.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.410
I'll take responsibility for you.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.900
This is hangover soup.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120
Drink it quickly.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.080
What do you mean?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.560
Last night we clearly...

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.850
Do you even know what happened last night?

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.040
You took off your clothes

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.440
and now you're pretending to have amnesia?

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.120
So

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.560
you took off your own clothes.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.680
Then what about my clothes?

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.810
I couldn't have taken them off myself.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.760
Call housekeeping.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.200
I...

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.140
I thought something would actually happen between us.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.460
Listen carefully.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.120
Nothing will ever happen

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.600
between us.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.610
So stop your wild imagination.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160
Stop right there.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.920
Are you leaving because I'm angry?

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.800
What?

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.320
Ma'am.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.060
Here you go.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.760
Take your clothes.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.220
I can't stay passive anymore.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.240
I need to find a way to make her give up sooner.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.280
Give up?

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.680
No way.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.920
Youyi.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.880
Any news?

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.080
No.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.540
Xiao Wan probably won't come.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.640
Although this film festival opening ceremony isn't large in scale,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.040
it's quite prestigious.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.680
They've invited award-winning actors,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.210
directors, and producers.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.400
You don't really

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.580
fit in with this festival.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.400
What do you mean I don't fit in?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.240
Did those actors win awards as soon as they entered the industry?

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.600
Didn't they all start from the bottom

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.460
and work their way up just like me?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.840
They didn't specifically say

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.580
that those without awards can't attend, right?

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.400
Youyi.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.080
As long as I haven't been explicitly rejected,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.140
it means I still have a chance, right?

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.480
Miss Ni.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.840
Are you getting rid of all these things?

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.170
Throw them away.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.360
Yes.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.880
Hello, Mr. Shen.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.480
There's a film festival opening ceremony.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.280
I think it's a good opportunity.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.290
I want to attend.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.480
This way, I can meet more people

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.980
and get more exposure.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.130
As long as it doesn't affect your work,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.290
how you manage your time is your business.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.840
Don't worry, it definitely won't.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.200
But the thing is,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.880
I don't have a formal dress.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.520
I got it.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.000
When trying on the dress,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.130
you need makeup to see the full effect.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.520
So...

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.280
Why is it you?

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.560
Mr. Shen said he's too busy to pick you up,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.290
so he asked me to take you there.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.480
This one is too small.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.320
This one is too big.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.080
This one doesn't fit.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:44.760
This one,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.680
this one,

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.000
and this one too.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.040
Let her try them on.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.400
Okay.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.330
I'm leaving now.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.300
Young Mr. Shen,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.040
you're deliberately avoiding her, aren't you?

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.440
On behalf of Mr. Shen senior and myself, I'm quite pleased.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.800
Aren't you reminding me every day

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.330
that she'll leave someday?

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.400
So I'm not seeing her. Is that okay with you?

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.080
Ying.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.530
Come on. It's over here.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.490
What a coincidence.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.400
Mr. Shen, who said he'd be busy all day,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.000
how come you're here?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.480
All because a certain artist wanted to try on dresses.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.360
Miss Zheng, please try this one first.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.480
Mr. Shen,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.060
can you stay and watch me try it on?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.130
Otherwise I won't feel confident.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.880
Sure.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.840
Trying to avoid me, huh?

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.120
I'll make sure you have nowhere to hide.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.760
Big drama alert.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.760
Mr. Shen,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.640
I can't reach the zipper on my back.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.760
Could you help me?

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.410
Miss Zheng, let me help you.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.359
I can't open it.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:22.890
Mr. Shen, could you help me?

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:24.880
I'll do it.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.720
It's just the two of us here.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.360
You can't keep avoiding me, can you?

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:38.960
Mr. Shen,

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.720
I just had some water

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.460
and need to touch up my makeup.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.320
So...

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.220
Go ahead and fix it.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.930
I'll hold it for you.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:17:59.760
No need.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.320
I have hands of my own.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.240
Playing is a child's nature.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.600
If he doesn't like toys,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.800
why not take him to do what he wants to do?

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.600
Today I'm going to play and have fun with him.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.560
Hello there.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.520
Have you finished your piano lesson?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.880
You still have Lego and programming classes later,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.920
and fencing and golf lessons in the evening.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.040
We need to hurry up!

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.600
I, Zheng Ying, am not someone who gives up easily.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.120
My life motto is:

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.240
As long as I don't lose hope,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.840
there's still hope for the future.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.300
Someone like Shen Yifan can't bring me down.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.600
There must be a way.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.460
Don't you think so, Youyi?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.480
Energy fully recharged.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.020
I'm about to turn into a tiger.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.160
You're quite fierce indeed.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.610
What are you going to do?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.600
Hunt.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.320
Mr. Shen,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.720
I know Miss Zheng Ying

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.520
has never been on a variety show before.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.960
But don't worry, Mr. Shen.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.240
Our show is very relaxed

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.080
and very friendly to performers.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.080
And as you know, this show

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.960
has already run for three seasons

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.400
with ratings above 8.5 for each season.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.400
If you've already done three seasons

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.060
and they were all successful,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.920
why change everything for season 4?

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.080
Precisely because we've done three seasons,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.040
it's getting stale.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.840
So

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.560
I want to try a new approach

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.600
and bring in

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.560
interesting guests with unique personalities.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.220
I think Zheng Ying is quite distinctive.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.440
Speak of the devil.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.920
I'm working.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.320
Work, huh?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.080
I understand.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.400
From now on, anything about his work,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.600
you can tell me.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.800
I've got his back.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.760
Zheng Ying is indeed special.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.340
Well, Mr. Shen,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.040
please consider our cooperation.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.200
I'll drink for him.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.040
Come in.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.600
Wu Yu.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.080
I'm here.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.880
Wu Yu.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.140
Let me handle this.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.160
That's it.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I understand what you're thinking.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.700
But you underestimated my persistence.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.300
And you underestimated my feelings for you.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.060
What do you want from me

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.480
to give up?

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.000
In my lifetime, the chance

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
to meet someone I truly like

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.600
probably comes just once.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.040
I won't give up.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.000
Are you touched by that?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.360
I dare not move.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.130
You said you had no feelings for me.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.160
Are you playing hard to get with me?

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.560
Zheng Ying.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.760
My patience has its limits.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.240
What are you so afraid of?

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.280
Do you know?

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.760
Some opportunities, once missed,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.820
can never be recovered, even with a lifetime of regret.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.280
Shen Yifan.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.690
I will make you understand this truth.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.160
Mr. Shen.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.320
Are you alright?

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:09.890
I'm fine.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.040
So she should give up now, right?

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.600
Handsome boy.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.600
Why are you alone? Where's your nanny?

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.320
I'm hungry.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.400
Well, I wonder if you'd like

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.060
to get a hamburger, handsome?

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.200
But we need to let your nanny know first,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:44.760
okay?

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.640
Okay.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:46.610
Let's go.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.760
It fell down.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.000
Great!

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.360
Come on.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.080
Can you be my daddy?

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.840
I have a daddy now!

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.480
I'm nervous now,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.810
but not because of this.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.520
So pathetic.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.620
Isn't this just like filming?

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.720
Just with a few more cameras.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.640
Let's welcome

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.170
Ni Shang and Zheng Ying to the interview area.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.560
Miss Ni Shang,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.520
may I ask if you're planning to continue your career back in China?

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.320
Actually, as an actress,

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.840
it doesn't matter where I work.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.240
Next walking on the red carpet

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.960
is our mysterious guest of the year,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.320
Mr. Shen Yifan.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.800
Miss Ni Shang,

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.680
do you have any stories from filming 'Tale of Two Beauties'

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.280
that you could share with us?

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.440
This film 'The Duel of Two Beauties'.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.960
Why is he here? Did he come to see me?

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.840
Her character

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.360
is very impressive in the film

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.440
and fully developed.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.080
Zheng Ying,

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.240
do you have anything you'd like to share with everyone?

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.160
Miss Zheng Ying, may I ask what role

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.360
you play in this film?

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.840
I play an assassin in this film.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.360
The cold-blooded, ruthless kind who's focused only on killing.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.200
How do you understand this character?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.000
Is she very different from who you are in real life?

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.280
I play an assassin in the film,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.120
but that doesn't mean I have

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.400
the same personality in real life.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.080
I still remember Miss Zheng Ying's

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.000
story about being brave in love and hate.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Miss Zheng, do you currently have a new relationship?

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:26.960
I'm sorry.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.440
Please try to ask questions

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.640
related to the work.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.480
Thank you.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.320
I have someone I like.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.880
Miss Zheng is indeed someone who loves and hates boldly.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.840
What about him?

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.240
Does he know how you feel?

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.120
He should be very clear about it.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.520
I'm just not sure

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.600
what kind of feelings he has for me.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.440
I'm also looking forward to

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.560
him giving me a clear answer.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.160
Mr. Shen,

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.920
how do you feel right now?

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.440
What I mean is,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.760
when capital generally doesn't favor

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.840
the film and TV industry,

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.520
you suddenly returned to China to enter the industry.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.640
During this time,

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.040
what are your thoughts about the industry?

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.850
To be honest,

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.720
I don't have any particular feelings.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.780
I am a businessman.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.340
Finding good projects

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.960
and good actors to work with

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.280
is my job.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.920
Anything beyond that,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.530
I couldn't care less about.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.240
Mr. Shen is indeed very rational.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.120
In that case,

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.360
Mr. Shen seems more like

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.760
a cold-blooded killer.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.120
Indeed.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.320
I'm sorry,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.120
excuse me.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.040
When luck turns against you,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.920
everything goes wrong.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.970
I have no feelings about this whatsoever.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.760
I don't care at all.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.760
Mr. Shen.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.200
This time,

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.040
she should give up.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:54.540
