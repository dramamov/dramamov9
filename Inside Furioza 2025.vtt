01:02.625 --> 01:04.166
-Look over there!
-Hey!

01:07.750 --> 01:09.875
Give it a rest! What are you doing?

01:11.666 --> 01:14.250
-Hold the wheel!
-Fucking go!

01:14.333 --> 01:15.750
You're fucking nuts.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.041
-Get the fuck out of the way!
-Enough.

01:20.416 --> 01:22.625
Where's your blinker, cunt?

01:22.708 --> 01:25.750
-Fuck!
-You're fucking crazy.

01:25.833 --> 01:28.583
-Insane.
-Hold it.

01:30.083 --> 01:32.833
Who gave you a fucking license?

01:32.916 --> 01:34.666
-When are the results?
-What?

01:35.416 --> 01:36.791
When do you get them?

01:37.791 --> 01:39.166
Fuck!

01:40.625 --> 01:41.833
On Friday.

01:41.916 --> 01:44.583
Why the fuck would you
go to medical school?

01:44.666 --> 01:45.791
Look!

01:47.541 --> 01:49.041
-It's them?
-What?

01:49.125 --> 01:51.000
-Them?
-I don't know! I can't see.

01:51.083 --> 01:52.000
I don't think so.

01:52.083 --> 01:54.375
They had a sweatshirt. Look inside.

01:54.458 --> 01:55.791
Check it.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.708
Fucking hell!

01:59.666 --> 02:01.416
-One had a sweatshirt.
-No.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.958
-He did.
-No sweatshirt!

02:03.041 --> 02:04.416
-Check!
-I can't see!

02:04.500 --> 02:05.541
Fuck it.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.625
How about now?

02:08.541 --> 02:09.583
Enough!

02:18.375 --> 02:19.875
Stop!

02:31.000 --> 02:32.625
And he rear-ended me.

02:35.458 --> 02:36.458
Brewsky?

02:38.041 --> 02:39.291
Fuck!

03:00.958 --> 03:02.500
Come on! Again!

03:13.458 --> 03:14.625
Fuck!

03:22.791 --> 03:26.625
Golden. He's had enough!

03:26.708 --> 03:27.541
Come on.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.375
Hey. Don't get up!

03:30.958 --> 03:32.875
-You okay?
-Yeah…

03:32.958 --> 03:33.875
Don't get up.

03:35.291 --> 03:38.000
-You want an ambulance?
-Fuck off!

03:41.250 --> 03:42.583
Dawid!

03:44.166 --> 03:45.625
I told you!

03:46.791 --> 03:47.666
It's them!

03:47.750 --> 03:49.958
No…

03:52.208 --> 03:55.041
Take off your crew's shirt!

03:57.333 --> 03:58.458
Take it off!

04:08.916 --> 04:13.000
Fury! Fury! Furioza!

04:13.083 --> 04:16.166
Fury! Fury! Furioza!

04:16.250 --> 04:20.875
Fury! Fury! Furioza!

04:28.875 --> 04:30.250
Ants are up in flames.

04:30.958 --> 04:34.583
-Fuck.
-This city is ours!

04:38.958 --> 04:39.791
Olo!

04:40.375 --> 04:42.750
-Mimi!
-I called you!

04:42.833 --> 04:44.250
I called you!

04:44.333 --> 04:46.708
What about the movie?
I bought two tickets.

04:46.791 --> 04:48.833
So you can watch it twice.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.291
-Wait.
-Or the sequel.

04:55.541 --> 04:57.750
Jesus, you just got here.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.583
Hey, check it out.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.541
Golden, nice!

05:04.375 --> 05:05.750
Fuck!

05:05.833 --> 05:08.166
Awesome ink.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.666
-Who did it?
-Your fucking mom.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.083
My mom inks better.

05:12.833 --> 05:15.208
-You could get it too, honey.
-Sexy.

05:15.291 --> 05:18.041
-Hold your horses.
-You know what?

05:18.125 --> 05:22.000
I'd rather not have
these cunts here at all.

05:22.083 --> 05:26.750
Krzywy? How did these
poor shipbuilders and dockers wrong us?

05:29.333 --> 05:30.750
Nice!

05:30.833 --> 05:33.416
I'm talking about Ants, Buła.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.791
Let me introduce, Mr. Kaszub.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.875
-From Kashubia!
-My blood!

05:45.166 --> 05:46.875
Fuck, a mohawk?

05:47.583 --> 05:50.000
Get a fucking tent and go to Jarocin.

05:50.083 --> 05:54.000
You lost your fucking mind, brother?
What the fuck did you do?

05:55.291 --> 05:57.458
Fuck, I'll go to Jarocin and sing.

05:57.541 --> 05:59.541
Furioza is never at peace

05:59.625 --> 06:01.958
Furioza fucks the police

06:02.041 --> 06:05.208
Here, you'll feel the brotherly love

06:05.291 --> 06:08.208
Fuck the police, we are above

06:08.291 --> 06:10.458
All right now, relax.

06:10.541 --> 06:15.166
Listen, the Anties
have their own crew shirts, right?

06:16.083 --> 06:18.708
-Today, we have ours.
-No!

06:19.458 --> 06:22.541
-No fucking way…
-I ordered 17.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.541
That will do for now.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.333
Some of you have to earn them.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.125
Like my brother.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.291
Golden.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.250
Everyone gets only one. Krzywy.

06:35.833 --> 06:38.500
-Buła.
-One for Buła.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.875
I'm going shirtless.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.583
They'll recognize me.

06:43.666 --> 06:46.750
-Gołota also fights shirtless.
-That wimp?

06:46.833 --> 06:50.291
You're a fucking wimp.
Has anyone heard about you?

06:50.375 --> 06:51.875
Everyone's heard about him.

06:51.958 --> 06:54.875
Everyone, and he's just a guy
from the block, like us.

06:54.958 --> 06:58.750
He had fuck all,
but he climbed to the top.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.625
And he quickly fell back down.

07:00.708 --> 07:04.291
Fuck, maybe he lost,
but he still messed Lewis' face up.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.458
How about his balls?

07:06.541 --> 07:09.666
I'd rather live one year as a tiger…

07:10.166 --> 07:11.833
than my whole life as a pussy.

07:11.916 --> 07:14.125
-Yeah.
-Why hold back?

07:14.208 --> 07:16.041
Yeah, why hold back?

07:21.833 --> 07:24.375
You played the game and went insane!

07:25.916 --> 07:27.625
-Fucking do something.
-Oh shit.

07:33.708 --> 07:34.541
You'll see.

07:35.458 --> 07:39.541
Every hooligan in Poland
will hear about us.

07:44.958 --> 07:46.500
Cool off, Golden!

08:06.000 --> 08:09.041
Golden! Is it him?

08:10.625 --> 08:12.541
You were supposed to confirm it.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.291
Can you hear me? Golden!

08:21.416 --> 08:23.125
Golden. Is it Kaszub?

08:36.833 --> 08:37.666
Dima.

08:40.166 --> 08:44.833
Listen to me! It's not him!
You hear me? It's not him!

08:46.125 --> 08:49.166
Stop!

09:05.708 --> 09:07.041
No!

09:07.750 --> 09:10.500
No! Fuck! No!

09:20.375 --> 09:22.208
No!

09:22.750 --> 09:24.083
No!

09:26.083 --> 09:27.666
No!

09:27.750 --> 09:30.708
Stop!

09:34.083 --> 09:36.250
-Run!
-Leave.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.000
What are you doing?

09:46.208 --> 09:47.500
Golden…

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
What?

10:14.958 --> 10:17.041
Move it!

10:17.125 --> 10:18.625
Quick!

10:18.708 --> 10:21.166
-To the forest!
-Fuck, give me the water.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.541
Golden, where are you? Fuck!

10:30.958 --> 10:33.208
Golden, where the fuck are you?

10:34.583 --> 10:36.416
Can you hear me? Respond!

10:37.583 --> 10:41.125
We're at the parking lot! Where are you?

10:41.208 --> 10:43.666
-I'm here.
-Get over here.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.250
I'll fucking kill you.

10:46.291 --> 10:49.500
We won't wait for you. Ten minutes!

10:52.708 --> 10:55.541
Come on, guys!

10:55.625 --> 10:57.916
Faster!

10:59.041 --> 11:00.666
Get to the cars.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.625
Take those things. Give it.

11:08.416 --> 11:11.041
He was supposed to live.
That was the deal.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.333
You stabbed him to death.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.708
Fucking death!

11:19.250 --> 11:20.291
You hear me?

11:23.375 --> 11:25.916
It's your business, your conscious,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.541
but our risk is higher.

11:27.625 --> 11:31.291
You hear me? Now, there will be a raise.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.833
-Forty.
-What?

11:35.916 --> 11:37.666
-Forty thousand.
-I don't have it.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.666
-Each.
-I don't have it now.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.083
I know.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.625
You'll pay it back later.

11:46.583 --> 11:47.833
Undress.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.666
Quickly, undress.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.208
-What is he waiting for?
-Relax, Irina.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.958
-"Relax"?
-Didn't you hear me?

11:57.583 --> 11:58.416
And the briefs.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.291
-Five minutes.
-No, two.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.125
-We should--
-Don't even think about it.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.041
We'll need him.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.083
Trust me.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.083
Suit yourself.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.625
Get to the cars, boys.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.333
Don't you get it?
We're wasting away in Poland.

12:32.416 --> 12:35.958
Over there, the market
is a hundred times bigger. No limits.

12:36.041 --> 12:39.416
Dublin, The Islands.
We can push our stuff with no limits.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.958
Fuck, Golden.

12:41.041 --> 12:43.583
-You bought a crib here?
-Here!

12:44.083 --> 12:45.041
See this connector?

12:46.166 --> 12:48.166
With the terrace. Fucking mine.

12:48.250 --> 12:52.125
- Can you clean up after your doggie?
- Fuck off.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.166
Hey!

12:54.250 --> 12:57.625
-Golden. I'll talk with him, okay?
-Okay.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.958
-Fuck, do I have to ask?
-You clean it up.

13:07.958 --> 13:08.916
Splash.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.791
Leave some for me, Kaszub.

13:25.541 --> 13:27.458
You can come to Gdynia.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.375
You can even sunbathe on our beach.

13:30.458 --> 13:34.291
But fuck, you can't make a mess
in our beautiful city. Pick it up.

13:34.375 --> 13:35.333
How? With what?

13:35.416 --> 13:37.958
You've got hands? Pick it the fuck up.

13:39.875 --> 13:41.583
There's a dog waste station.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.583
Everything.

13:46.666 --> 13:47.708
Yo!

14:11.833 --> 14:13.791
Nice setup!

14:14.416 --> 14:18.000
Aren't you pissed that Mrówka
took everything from us on The Islands?

14:18.083 --> 14:20.166
That he took our guys in Ireland?

14:20.250 --> 14:23.666
Ireland should be ours.
The money we'll make…

14:25.416 --> 14:27.416
Yo, he didn't fight back.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.916
Together, we can do anything. You and I.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.083
Look.

14:39.375 --> 14:43.416
This city can be ours, up to this horizon!

14:43.916 --> 14:45.583
Up to the horizon!

14:46.625 --> 14:49.333
We have the framework,
the people, everything.

14:49.416 --> 14:51.208
Even this horizon is no limit.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.875
Leave it.

14:53.666 --> 14:57.541
Mrówka gets his product
on The Islands by the port.

15:00.291 --> 15:01.125
Our port.

15:03.208 --> 15:05.625
Yes, there's a port in Gdynia.

15:06.541 --> 15:09.583
-But it's not ours.
-Let's just ice Polański.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.541
Kill him?

15:17.291 --> 15:18.916
You're fucked up, Golden.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.958
I love you, bro. But if you stir shit,
I'll kick you out of Furioza.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.458
But Polański pays me pennies.

15:28.791 --> 15:33.416
Pennies! Pennies that paid for this suite?

15:34.708 --> 15:36.916
Golden, fuck, what more do you want?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.208
I want to go higher!

15:38.291 --> 15:41.958
Kaszub! Higher, more,
higher, harder, more!

15:42.041 --> 15:45.000
More! Higher! More! Higher!

15:45.083 --> 15:46.250
Higher! More!

15:46.916 --> 15:49.541
-Dude!
-Higher! More!

15:49.625 --> 15:52.583
You can buy five floors up
and five floors down,

15:52.666 --> 15:55.875
but you'll always be a guy from the block.

15:55.958 --> 15:58.208
"Higher!"

16:42.791 --> 16:43.958
I can't.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.458
You were our brother, Kaszub.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.875
You created history.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.625
You'll always be a legend.

17:59.833 --> 18:00.916
Kaszub…

18:02.750 --> 18:04.000
It's Buła.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.083
I'll avenge you, my friend. I swear!

18:13.625 --> 18:16.458
Fuck, Mrówa, you're dead!

18:17.583 --> 18:20.416
I'll kill you with your own
fucking pitchfork!

18:20.500 --> 18:22.875
Fuck!

18:22.958 --> 18:24.000
Mrówa…

18:29.791 --> 18:30.875
Kaszub.

18:31.875 --> 18:36.333
First, I want to apologize
that I wasn't there.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.583
That we weren't there.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.125
I speak for our whole crew.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.083
You founded Furioza.

18:49.375 --> 18:53.666
You shaped us. You taught us everything.

18:53.750 --> 18:57.541
Fury! Fury! Furioza!

18:57.625 --> 19:00.208
The Lord says, "Beloved,

19:01.708 --> 19:07.125
never avenge yourselves,
but leave it to the wrath of God.

19:09.458 --> 19:12.041
Vengeance is mine.

19:12.833 --> 19:14.541
I will repay."

19:18.416 --> 19:21.083
Therefore, forgive me, Lord,
for my future sins.

19:23.833 --> 19:27.500
INSIDE FURIOZA

19:29.583 --> 19:32.500
Crowds like at
Nikodem Skotarczak's funeral in '98.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.500
Fuck me! Him? Shit!

19:39.958 --> 19:41.583
Everyone to the urn!

19:43.833 --> 19:46.541
Honey, don't go. Fuck.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.916
To the urn! Shit!

19:54.916 --> 19:56.458
Fucking hell.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.833
What the fuck is he doing here?

19:59.333 --> 20:01.000
Wait.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.583
Hey!

20:04.000 --> 20:05.958
Why the fuck did you come? Relax!

20:06.833 --> 20:08.291
Leave it and fuck off.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.750
Not here! Pigs are here.

20:11.833 --> 20:15.625
Fuck, relax! Pigs are everywhere!

20:15.708 --> 20:19.708
Back the fuck up! If these guys explode,
it's going to be a massacre.

20:19.791 --> 20:20.833
Come out!

20:20.916 --> 20:23.541
-What the fuck?
-Come out!

20:23.625 --> 20:25.333
What the fuck?

20:29.333 --> 20:30.583
Back the fuck up.

20:31.166 --> 20:34.416
-Back up.
-Fuck off! Why do you provoke?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.208
-You hear, Marcin?
-Hands off!

20:36.291 --> 20:39.333
Leave those weeds and fuck off,
like they told you.

20:44.958 --> 20:47.375
Fuck off, Mrówa. You're already dead!

20:49.250 --> 20:50.708
I fought…

20:53.208 --> 20:55.666
with Kaszub all my life!

20:55.750 --> 20:57.291
These are his scars!

20:57.375 --> 20:58.958
Fuck off, Mrówa!

20:59.041 --> 21:00.541
I don't hold it against him!

21:00.625 --> 21:02.250
-What the fuck?
-Get out!

21:02.833 --> 21:04.875
I honor him!

21:05.958 --> 21:08.875
I see crews from all over Poland!

21:09.583 --> 21:11.958
You're here to say goodbye to Kaszub,

21:12.666 --> 21:14.500
because he was a true hooligan!

21:15.083 --> 21:17.666
Real, good, old school!

21:17.750 --> 21:19.333
Fuck off, you hear?

21:19.416 --> 21:21.666
-Get the fuck out!
-Fuck off!

21:21.750 --> 21:23.625
Marcin, fucking leave.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.500
Get the fuck out, now!

21:28.583 --> 21:30.333
These are my colors!

21:31.166 --> 21:33.541
-Take it and leave!
-Hide that rag.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.041
This is how you say goodbye…

21:35.125 --> 21:37.166
Get the fuck out of here!

21:37.250 --> 21:39.083
You'll die, bitch!

21:39.166 --> 21:40.208
…to the greats.

21:40.291 --> 21:43.083
Marcin, enough.
If I leave you here, they'll kill you.

21:44.458 --> 21:46.458
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

21:48.958 --> 21:50.541
Get the fuck out!

21:50.625 --> 21:51.875
Fuck off!

21:51.958 --> 21:53.291
Don't reach for the gun!

21:53.375 --> 21:55.458
I'll fucking kill you!

21:56.208 --> 21:57.708
I'll kill you!

21:57.791 --> 21:59.375
-Fuck off!
-Fuck!

22:02.416 --> 22:03.583
Where did he go?

22:04.625 --> 22:08.291
Fuck, enough! Quiet!

22:08.375 --> 22:09.416
After him.

22:09.500 --> 22:13.166
Enough! This is a fucking funeral!

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Back up.

22:17.833 --> 22:19.541
Parking. Up top.

22:37.791 --> 22:40.166
Wait. Now.

22:45.541 --> 22:47.875
…soccer supporters
from around the country.

22:47.958 --> 22:52.416
The police are looking for the murderer
of the Furioza soccer fan group's leader.

22:52.500 --> 22:56.333
Fucking "soccer fan group"? Fuck that!

22:56.416 --> 22:58.500
Fucking farmer's wives association!

22:59.250 --> 23:00.500
Don't get too close.

23:00.583 --> 23:03.666
Like this. That piece of shit
has to step out somewhere.

23:05.625 --> 23:08.875
-What then?
-You'll run into him.

23:10.666 --> 23:14.750
I'll jump out, pummel him with gear,
and we get the fuck out.

23:16.250 --> 23:17.333
All right.

23:25.291 --> 23:26.625
He's turning.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.083
Fucker's about to step out.

23:39.583 --> 23:42.208
Wait. Fucking go!

23:42.291 --> 23:43.958
Won't get a better shot! Go!

23:44.041 --> 23:47.166
-Maybe it's not him.
-He killed your brother. Go!

23:50.416 --> 23:53.083
Aim in the middle! Fucking middle!

23:54.541 --> 23:56.666
Fuck! Back up!

23:56.750 --> 23:57.625
Fuck!

23:58.750 --> 24:00.500
-Reverse!
-Get the fuck out!

24:01.333 --> 24:03.208
-Fuck off!
-Stop!

24:07.708 --> 24:09.666
Don't move! Police!

24:12.666 --> 24:14.875
Move the fuck away from him!

24:14.958 --> 24:19.416
Whoa, Madam Commissioner! Holy fuck!

24:19.500 --> 24:23.041
Watch out, or next time
you'll hit the gas pump.

24:23.125 --> 24:25.583
Do you have a loose screw?
Who the fuck are you?

24:26.166 --> 24:27.458
Young Kaszub.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.375
Gas station by Ikea.
Give me everyone you have.

24:30.458 --> 24:33.250
Madam Commissioner, hold on!

24:34.416 --> 24:37.416
-Fuck, you have your brother's eyes.
-They have weapons.

24:37.500 --> 24:38.833
Let's go!

24:39.333 --> 24:41.791
-They're leaving.
-This family's had enough drama.

24:41.875 --> 24:44.416
-Three cars. A black Mercedes.
-To the cars!

24:44.500 --> 24:46.250
-BMW, GD 67486.
-They're mourning!

24:46.333 --> 24:48.125
Audi A6. The weapon is in the Audi.

24:50.208 --> 24:51.958
Dzika, fuck!

24:52.041 --> 24:56.583
Get the fuck out of here!
I will let this pass this one time!

24:57.166 --> 24:59.583
-Leave Mrówka to us.
-To you, for fuck's sake?

24:59.666 --> 25:02.083
Yes, the police handle the murders.

25:02.583 --> 25:04.375
Doctors save people.

25:06.041 --> 25:07.250
You want to kill?

25:08.208 --> 25:09.666
You think you can live with it?

25:11.750 --> 25:14.250
Get the fuck out of here!

25:23.000 --> 25:25.375
MILKY WAY

25:26.208 --> 25:28.000
Quickly!

25:28.083 --> 25:30.791
Kaszub opposed you. Did you do it?

25:30.875 --> 25:33.375
Fucking milk for grownups!

25:36.666 --> 25:38.708
We have to get along with Golden.

25:40.166 --> 25:43.583
Ireland and The Islands
are an important topic.

25:43.666 --> 25:46.500
And you're still playing hooligans
like children.

25:46.583 --> 25:48.583
When the fuck will you wise up?

25:48.666 --> 25:50.041
Move it there!

25:50.125 --> 25:52.666
Messi! Figo's all out of energy!

25:52.750 --> 25:55.291
After what happened,
Golden will want a war.

25:55.375 --> 25:56.916
I only retreat forward.

25:57.416 --> 26:00.666
Sure, and in two years,
I'll be one year sober.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.875
-Go!
-Come on!

26:02.958 --> 26:04.041
Watch him go!

26:04.125 --> 26:06.625
Kaszub didn't care,
but Golden wants to make money.

26:06.708 --> 26:08.250
Fuck, not with me.

26:09.958 --> 26:12.000
Golden loves big money.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.458
You too.

26:14.291 --> 26:18.125
And big money likes quiet.
Quiet on its turf.

26:22.333 --> 26:25.166
It's not Colombia.
You won't kill everyone.

26:27.833 --> 26:28.958
Come on!

26:35.958 --> 26:39.250
Right, we're taking Mrówa
and his lackeys for 48 hours.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.041
Fuck!

26:42.833 --> 26:45.291
One of them will spill their guts.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.333
Yeah, right.

26:48.125 --> 26:49.125
Want one?

26:52.666 --> 26:54.833
Patience, Dzika!

26:55.458 --> 26:59.500
More patience. Besides who knows?

27:01.083 --> 27:05.500
Maybe we'll manage to stop
their little war for a moment.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.166
What do you think, Dzika?

27:07.250 --> 27:09.958
Can we do it? Shit!

27:10.041 --> 27:11.000
DON'T WAIT, ACT

27:11.083 --> 27:11.916
Or…

27:13.291 --> 27:14.291
not?

27:19.500 --> 27:20.916
Attention, everyone.

27:33.083 --> 27:35.041
There's no video from the crime scene.

27:35.125 --> 27:37.625
There are some screeches
in the audio recording.

27:37.708 --> 27:40.500
Let's figure out what it is. We work 24/7.

28:39.541 --> 28:40.916
Police!

28:41.583 --> 28:43.625
-Police! Stop!
-Yeah?

28:43.708 --> 28:46.125
Mrówka, I'm on probation.
They can't take me!

28:46.208 --> 28:49.333
Relax. I'll hide you in Dublin.
I'll need you there.

28:49.416 --> 28:50.708
-Later.
-In Dublin…

28:54.333 --> 28:56.333
-Hold it, fucker!
-Run!

28:56.416 --> 28:57.750
Stop!

29:01.041 --> 29:02.458
On the ground!

29:03.458 --> 29:04.458
On the ground!

29:06.166 --> 29:07.875
Police!

29:08.833 --> 29:10.333
Clear!

29:11.250 --> 29:13.958
Today we're doing toning exercises…

29:14.041 --> 29:15.208
Where's Mrówka?

29:15.291 --> 29:17.333
…very nice consistency…

29:17.416 --> 29:20.916
Mr. Mrówka. He asked to tell you
he'll visit you himself.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.333
…when it reaches the impurities…

29:35.416 --> 29:37.750
-Who is it?
-He's not a smart player.

29:37.833 --> 29:40.125
The ball was very slow.

29:40.208 --> 29:41.208
Should we take him?

29:41.291 --> 29:43.208
Do you have a warrant for this crib?

29:43.291 --> 29:45.416
Madam Obersturmbannführer! Sandwich?

29:45.500 --> 29:47.500
He missed! No goal.

29:48.833 --> 29:54.208
Police! Police!
Sing with us

29:54.291 --> 29:58.541
Police! Police!
Get fucked in the ass…

29:58.625 --> 30:01.708
Are you fucking insane?
What is this, a concert hall?

30:01.791 --> 30:05.875
Police! Police!
Sing with us

30:05.958 --> 30:06.833
Get fucked…

30:06.916 --> 30:09.583
-Fuck off!
-What you looking at?

30:09.666 --> 30:11.041
Get fucked in the ass…

30:11.125 --> 30:12.125
Fuck off!

30:12.208 --> 30:15.333
Police!

30:15.416 --> 30:17.625
My police…

30:17.708 --> 30:20.708
Mr. Konrad.
When did you last see Mr. Kaszub?

30:21.208 --> 30:23.375
Kashubia? No… Oh, Kaszub.

30:24.541 --> 30:27.541
Shoot, I don't remember.
But I have it all in my diary.

30:27.625 --> 30:31.375
Maybe you could get it for me?
Or you, miss?

30:32.458 --> 30:34.041
Shall I give you the keys?

30:34.125 --> 30:37.250
Let's try this. What were you doing
on July 1st, at 9 p.m.?

30:37.333 --> 30:40.833
Nine p.m.? 37 minutes of yoga. Always.

30:41.916 --> 30:45.875
I was doing the Sun Salutation
and then… the Pig.

30:45.958 --> 30:49.541
In Gdańsk, we have the Anthill.
Gdynia has those cunts from Furioza.

30:49.625 --> 30:52.875
And then there's Sopot. That's pure evil.

30:52.958 --> 30:54.916
But it's all Kashubia.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.083
No one has killed it,
so I don't understand.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.208
I was doing yoga, you get me?

31:01.416 --> 31:05.541
You think it's so easy to rule?

31:08.625 --> 31:10.583
You're not cut out for it.

31:17.291 --> 31:21.583
Which night? I didn't hear you.

31:24.166 --> 31:28.250
Oh, we made a mess, huh? A little oopsie?

31:28.333 --> 31:32.958
Well, in that case,
here you go, gentlemen.

31:33.500 --> 31:37.208
Here, have all of that.
Fucking, have a snack.

31:37.291 --> 31:41.083
Take a shit in here as well,
why don't you?

31:41.166 --> 31:42.250
Too bad.

31:48.166 --> 31:50.875
Fucking hell!

31:50.958 --> 31:53.916
…so I'm spinning that little propeller…

32:03.583 --> 32:06.541
We had Mrówka at the station.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.250
You fucked up.

32:08.333 --> 32:10.708
I don't need
somebody like that in my crew.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.791
Right, to the pit with him.

32:13.875 --> 32:14.875
No!

32:17.916 --> 32:18.750
No pit.

32:19.333 --> 32:20.666
…the stars, celebrities…

32:20.750 --> 32:26.875
For fuck's sake!
You want to play like a fucking clown?

32:26.958 --> 32:29.333
Your buddy is already talking.

32:29.416 --> 32:32.000
He's cooperating.
And you want to give us bullshit?

32:32.083 --> 32:33.125
You don't have shit.

32:33.208 --> 32:36.166
-Why are you holding me if he's talking?
-Jacek!

32:36.250 --> 32:40.250
-Fuck, Jacek!
-I want my lawyer!

32:40.333 --> 32:41.291
Mr. Commissioner!

32:41.375 --> 32:43.583
-You fucker!
-Fuck off!

32:43.666 --> 32:46.750
-Jacek!
-What the fuck?

32:50.041 --> 32:51.083
Yes?

32:52.750 --> 32:54.541
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

32:54.625 --> 32:57.375
-Hello, Ms. Marta.
-Everything okay, Konrad?

32:58.833 --> 33:00.833
-I don't give a shit.
-He doesn't care.

33:01.541 --> 33:03.916
Mr. Mrówczyński
was supposed to come for questioning.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.791
Fuck, Jacek!

33:06.541 --> 33:07.583
Please.

33:08.166 --> 33:12.416
Let the record show
that my client came here willingly.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.291
He'll give his statement
only in my presence.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.333
And with no use of force.

33:17.416 --> 33:18.333
And…

33:19.208 --> 33:24.416
before Madam General asks
what was I doing on July 1st at 9 p.m.,

33:24.500 --> 33:28.250
I was in church, at a BDSM party.

33:28.333 --> 33:31.916
Although, Madam Admiral,
let the record show,

33:32.000 --> 33:36.416
that I hate priests, fucking pedophiles,
who fuck little kids in the ass

33:36.500 --> 33:39.291
and surround themselves
with pussy politicians.

33:39.375 --> 33:42.083
-It's them you should arrest, Jacek, no?
-Which ones?

33:43.500 --> 33:44.875
Both, Jacek, my man.

33:44.958 --> 33:46.916
We don't have enough cells.

33:52.166 --> 33:53.791
Fuck, Dzika.

33:56.291 --> 33:58.000
I killed Kaszub…

33:59.875 --> 34:02.625
I left my pitchfork,
though without my prints.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.541
But it's a pitchfork, so it's me.

34:05.333 --> 34:06.750
Are you insane?

34:09.875 --> 34:11.166
Well, Jacek?

34:11.833 --> 34:14.750
You also think I'm that fucking stupid?

34:30.458 --> 34:32.833
Sawbones, is this enough?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.708
-Water.
-Fuck!

34:48.750 --> 34:52.500
As they taught you in school,
pour acid into water, don't be a fool.

34:53.541 --> 34:54.583
Who has gasoline?

35:03.750 --> 35:04.833
Well!

35:07.250 --> 35:11.583
Thanks to my vigilance
and divine providence,

35:12.083 --> 35:14.875
which, as we know,
is only for the chosen ones,

35:14.958 --> 35:17.458
we finally start to use
what was always ours.

35:19.666 --> 35:22.166
We'll avenge Kaszub like I promised.

35:52.333 --> 35:56.041
Keep moving, dude. The yellow bus.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.333
-Fuck, how do you go up?
-Press down.

36:00.416 --> 36:03.541
-Down to go fucking up?
-Up to go down, down to go up.

36:03.625 --> 36:06.041
-Right to go left?
-No, right is right.

36:06.125 --> 36:07.750
How do you shoot?

36:18.250 --> 36:19.250
Here you go.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.166
-Are you fucking insane?
-You know it!

36:33.041 --> 36:34.875
-Yes, I do.
-Come on.

36:38.791 --> 36:42.666
-How long will they stay here?
-Just a few more days.

36:48.208 --> 36:49.750
So what's up?

36:49.833 --> 36:51.541
I traced the phone

36:51.625 --> 36:54.708
which was close to the cell
belonging to Polański's bodyguard.

36:54.791 --> 36:57.583
-Yeah?
-It sent this text.

37:00.416 --> 37:03.833
"They got me. You know who.
Goodnight, dear son?"

37:03.916 --> 37:06.458
What the fuck is this?
Why are you showing me this?

37:06.541 --> 37:08.041
He's a veteran gangster.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.416
He's going to his death.
He knows how to send a cryptic message.

37:12.125 --> 37:16.291
Give us something helpful and concrete.
Where did he send this?

37:16.375 --> 37:17.833
To what number?

37:17.916 --> 37:22.250
That number was logging in
every 10 minutes on different continents.

37:22.333 --> 37:25.208
Then shit, we have fuck all.

37:27.958 --> 37:32.625
Except for this. This text was sent
in the vicinity of this shooting range.

37:41.958 --> 37:44.958
-Well?
-No trace of blood.

37:50.083 --> 37:52.541
They even changed the carpet.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.500
This is how dinosaurs meet their end.

37:57.541 --> 38:03.041
He was the last old-school, 90s gangster.
The change is coming, Dzika.

38:04.041 --> 38:06.125
We can't stop it.

38:06.208 --> 38:08.166
I'll check the CCTV.

38:16.791 --> 38:18.500
-Surprised?
-Yeah?

38:25.000 --> 38:28.208
This port has always been ours.
Say hi to Mrówka.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.166
-Out!
-No beating this time!

38:31.250 --> 38:34.916
Get back to Gdańsk!
This port is fucking ours!

38:41.833 --> 38:44.750
-Polański was an old coot.
-Yeah…

38:44.833 --> 38:46.666
Just a fucking asshole, right?

38:46.750 --> 38:48.083
Yes. That's right.

38:48.666 --> 38:51.708
-What about me?
-No, you're totally different.

38:53.583 --> 38:55.583
MILKY WAY

39:00.458 --> 39:02.333
-They blocked us.
-It's not our fault.

39:02.416 --> 39:03.916
-Golden?
-Golden, Krzywy.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.833
-The whole fucking Furioza.
-Why?

39:06.916 --> 39:07.958
There were too many.

39:08.041 --> 39:11.416
-Why were there only two of you?
-We always go alone.

39:11.500 --> 39:14.291
-Always.
-Fuck!

39:14.375 --> 39:16.625
Don't do it! Fuck!

39:17.833 --> 39:21.583
Fuck! Motherfucking Golden!

39:21.666 --> 39:23.666
Motherfucking Furioza!

39:23.750 --> 39:26.541
Furioza never leaves their own!

39:26.625 --> 39:28.083
Never!

39:28.166 --> 39:29.833
-Never!
-Beautiful!

39:31.166 --> 39:35.208
I'll fucking kill them all!

40:03.500 --> 40:05.416
Yeah? I'll come down.

40:08.458 --> 40:09.916
Password?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.666
Wrzescz, Pruszcz, Czew.

40:11.750 --> 40:12.583
"Tczew."

40:13.791 --> 40:15.833
-"Tczew." Say it.
-Czew.

40:15.916 --> 40:17.791
"T." Starts with a "T."

40:26.791 --> 40:27.916
Coffee or tea?

40:28.000 --> 40:30.708
Coffee doesn't exclude tea.

40:30.791 --> 40:32.833
Then I'll mix it for you.

40:39.958 --> 40:42.000
-Audi.
-The worst one.

40:42.916 --> 40:43.750
Kia.

40:43.833 --> 40:44.916
Ford.

40:49.041 --> 40:50.291
Fuck, the Škoda?

40:50.375 --> 40:52.666
Yeah, so what?

41:13.250 --> 41:14.625
May I help you?

41:16.875 --> 41:18.375
You'll sell me this Lambo.

41:22.166 --> 41:23.291
But not today.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.541
Now I'll take the gold one.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.000
Nice setup.

41:58.041 --> 41:59.166
Golden.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.125
You can buy five floors up

42:11.208 --> 42:14.875
and five floors down,
but you'll always be…

42:14.958 --> 42:16.500
…a guy from the block.

42:24.875 --> 42:25.833
Honey.

42:26.875 --> 42:28.875
You can't be so sad.

42:31.125 --> 42:34.166
Szadzia has something for you.
Here, suck on this.

42:34.250 --> 42:35.541
I don't want to.

42:39.083 --> 42:40.000
No.

42:40.916 --> 42:42.375
We know what you need.

42:43.041 --> 42:45.666
Golden. Come.

42:50.041 --> 42:51.083
Here you go.

42:55.916 --> 42:56.916
Better?

43:00.375 --> 43:02.708
More. Give me more.

43:58.291 --> 43:59.541
Zoom in.

44:03.083 --> 44:04.208
What are they buying?

44:04.708 --> 44:09.166
Caustic soda.
Why do they need it? Fucking beekeepers?

44:11.291 --> 44:13.041
Whoa! You deleted it.

44:13.125 --> 44:15.125
It's "Miss" to you. Got a problem?

44:17.041 --> 44:18.333
Are you sure?

44:22.958 --> 44:25.583
Imagine you're a leaf.

44:26.583 --> 44:28.958
The wind is getting stronger. Like that.

44:29.041 --> 44:32.291
It's so strong
that it plucks you from the branch.

44:32.875 --> 44:35.375
Now it's raining. You're so cold.

44:35.458 --> 44:38.541
Faster! There are so many raindrops!

44:38.625 --> 44:40.208
-The wind is pulling.
-It's her.

44:40.291 --> 44:41.416
Like that!

44:42.333 --> 44:45.916
It plucks you from the branch.
Scatter across the room.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.125
The wind pulls you, shakes you.

44:48.208 --> 44:49.833
To the right! To the left!

44:49.916 --> 44:51.875
Let's go! It shakes you!

44:51.958 --> 44:54.375
It shakes you. Now, there's a storm.

44:54.458 --> 44:57.666
A lightning bolt strikes the leaves.
Like that.

44:57.750 --> 44:59.750
Breathe. I can't hear you breathing.

44:59.833 --> 45:01.166
Now you suddenly fall.

45:01.250 --> 45:04.458
-Now there's a puddle.
-Fuck, look at them.

45:05.583 --> 45:08.541
And now a stream. You're in it.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.333
Cold raindrops. The wind is pulling you…

45:11.416 --> 45:13.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

45:13.333 --> 45:14.458
Wide. Don't stop.

45:16.208 --> 45:19.416
-Can I enroll with you?
-Yes, after the class.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.833
-I can't. I'm leaving.
-Then you won't enroll.

45:21.916 --> 45:23.416
Will you be my girlfriend?

45:23.500 --> 45:24.583
How about wife?

45:29.708 --> 45:30.958
That also works.

45:32.458 --> 45:35.291
I bought more.
I didn't know which one you'd like.

45:36.166 --> 45:37.750
-So?
-No.

45:37.833 --> 45:39.583
-What?
-No. Take them.

45:39.666 --> 45:40.916
-I'll be back soon.
-No…

45:41.000 --> 45:42.083
Keep them, miss.

45:42.166 --> 45:44.041
-Keep them.
-Bye!

45:44.125 --> 45:45.458
No…

45:49.458 --> 45:52.291
-Just like that.
-Olo, this is not Tricity.

45:52.375 --> 45:55.291
They're weaker there.
We'll surprise them with no problem.

45:55.375 --> 45:57.625
-You can't be sure.
-Jesus!

45:57.708 --> 45:59.625
There, we have to go in hard.

45:59.708 --> 46:01.958
-Can you get him in Gdańsk?
-Will he be there?

46:02.041 --> 46:05.208
Can you get him in Sopot?
Fuck, will that work better?

46:05.291 --> 46:08.416
He's sly. Do you have a better plan?

46:09.041 --> 46:10.666
How do you say "Buła" in Irish?

46:11.916 --> 46:15.041
He'll be there.
He has too much to lose in Dublin.

46:15.125 --> 46:16.791
That's better. We'll get him abroad.

46:16.875 --> 46:20.291
And if we don't,
at least we'll have a trip to Dublin.

46:20.375 --> 46:22.750
I'll get the tickets.
Golden, by the window?

46:22.833 --> 46:25.166
-Yeah, but in a car. We're driving.
-Yeah?

46:25.250 --> 46:27.958
Plain, inconspicuous cars. Got it?

46:28.041 --> 46:31.250
-Got it.
-You're with us, Oluś?

46:38.416 --> 46:40.333
-All right.
-Awesome!

46:40.833 --> 46:45.041
But, like Golden said, we're driving.

46:45.125 --> 46:47.458
No more than three in a car.

46:47.541 --> 46:52.000
We obey the traffic laws.
We get no tickets. We pay only in cash.

46:52.083 --> 46:55.291
-Buy some euros. Small bills.
-Yes.

46:55.375 --> 46:56.666
-Zero troubles.
-Zero.

46:56.750 --> 46:59.166
-No gas station promotions, nothing.
-Nothing.

47:00.291 --> 47:03.375
If a cop pulls you over,
you're going back to Poland.

47:03.458 --> 47:04.500
-Yes.
-Of course.

47:07.541 --> 47:11.125
How do you drive to a fucking island?

47:27.833 --> 47:28.916
Is Bauer here?

47:29.416 --> 47:31.208
I haven't seen him in three days.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.375
No one has ever found me here.

47:58.375 --> 47:59.958
Was anyone looking?

48:03.375 --> 48:04.875
Not in a long time.

48:24.375 --> 48:26.166
This is our fate, Dzika.

48:26.750 --> 48:29.541
But despite everything and

48:30.625 --> 48:35.708
everyone, we have to carry on
as pigs, right?

48:38.458 --> 48:39.791
'Cause…

48:40.500 --> 48:41.750
the dynamics…

48:43.041 --> 48:44.541
Oh, that's on me.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.541
The dynamics are important.

48:57.833 --> 48:58.875
Fuck.

49:04.291 --> 49:08.916
Do you have anything from the CCTV?

49:13.083 --> 49:17.083
Right, Mrówka was working with Polański.

49:17.166 --> 49:21.458
Have Prorok give us the green light.

49:21.541 --> 49:25.083
And we start working in the morning.

49:25.166 --> 49:27.166
Add that to my tab.

49:27.250 --> 49:29.625
POLISH SHOP

49:30.625 --> 49:33.625
Dude, we have everything here.
It's like Momma's house.

49:33.708 --> 49:37.083
Best fucking food in all of Dublin. Catch.

49:37.166 --> 49:39.291
Look, kefir. You have everything here.

49:41.333 --> 49:44.375
-Like we're home!
-Zeta, who is this now?

49:44.458 --> 49:46.166
I can't believe it!

49:46.250 --> 49:48.000
-Wassup?
-You came!

49:48.083 --> 49:50.375
I'll show you where you're staying. Come.

49:50.458 --> 49:52.000
-See you.
-See you.

49:52.083 --> 49:53.375
Here.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.708
You remember when I said
that Zeta works for Mrówka?

49:57.791 --> 49:58.958
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

49:59.916 --> 50:02.041
I was joking.

50:02.125 --> 50:03.541
Zeta!

50:04.833 --> 50:07.208
-Wassup?
-Where's Rysiek?

50:07.291 --> 50:09.000
No Rysiek, life is good.

50:10.541 --> 50:11.500
Hold on.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.791
It's here. Get in.

50:17.041 --> 50:18.625
Let's go, gentlemen.

50:21.541 --> 50:23.875
So cringy.
You want to wear this in Dublin?

50:23.958 --> 50:27.375
-What? I'm proud to be Polish.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

50:27.458 --> 50:31.583
It's not an accomplishment.
Your parents simply made you in Poland.

50:31.666 --> 50:36.041
If anything,
you can be happy to be Polish.

50:37.125 --> 50:38.583
What's to be happy about?

50:40.041 --> 50:42.375
-You want a Guinness?
-You have a Specjal?

50:42.458 --> 50:44.750
It's me, Zeta. Open up.

50:44.833 --> 50:46.416
-Hi.
-Come in.

50:48.333 --> 50:50.500
What the fuck?

50:50.583 --> 50:52.000
What… All right!

50:55.833 --> 50:57.000
Fuck!

50:57.583 --> 50:59.291
We're taking over Dublin.

51:01.625 --> 51:06.041
Get all your guys,
and we can fight over it.

51:08.333 --> 51:09.750
Hands or gear?

51:11.375 --> 51:12.416
Gear.

52:33.250 --> 52:34.333
Hey, Siri.

52:36.958 --> 52:38.666
Call Mrówa.

52:40.625 --> 52:43.666
Call Mrówa.

52:46.250 --> 52:47.583
Mrówa.

52:50.666 --> 52:51.583
Mrówa.

52:53.416 --> 52:57.791
No, kurwa, I could not repeat,
you motherfucking artificial intelligence.

52:57.875 --> 53:00.500
Call fucking Mrówa!

53:07.000 --> 53:07.916
What?

53:08.000 --> 53:09.166
Mrówa.

53:10.291 --> 53:11.541
Is something wrong?

53:12.625 --> 53:15.375
-Call me on the second phone.
-Calling.

53:20.916 --> 53:22.208
Oh God.

53:24.666 --> 53:25.625
Go.

53:33.458 --> 53:34.291
Oh fuck…

53:44.166 --> 53:46.041
What the fuck?

53:46.541 --> 53:48.208
-Here?
-Yeah.

53:52.291 --> 53:58.750
Zeta! A mountain never meets a mountain,
but Furioza can meet the Anthill.

53:58.833 --> 54:02.833
You know this joke about shock?
The ten of you will get shocked.

54:11.708 --> 54:12.708
Hey!

54:12.791 --> 54:15.000
Leave that one. I like it.

54:15.083 --> 54:15.916
All right.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.291
MRÓWKA, THE LORD OF POMERANIA
HE THINKS HIP-HOP IS A SPINE DISORDER

54:39.333 --> 54:42.333
You know where one can get
a good cup of coffee here?

54:42.416 --> 54:44.916
-Poolbeg Chimneys.
-What?

54:45.500 --> 54:47.666
-Docks by the port.
-Fuck off.

54:47.750 --> 54:49.458
-I'll send you a pin.
-Go.

54:50.833 --> 54:53.958
-How? Do you have my number?
-Do something!

54:58.250 --> 55:00.791
Run, Lola, Run!

55:00.875 --> 55:03.250
Go left, go right!

55:07.291 --> 55:10.458
They raided us.
They knew where the money and drugs were.

55:10.541 --> 55:11.791
Who ratted us out?

55:11.875 --> 55:14.500
Fucking Zeta! It was Zeta!

55:14.583 --> 55:15.958
I'll fucking kill him.

55:16.041 --> 55:19.875
We set up a brawl in the docks,
in Irish Town. It's a good spot.

55:19.958 --> 55:22.500
-Hands or gear?
-Fucking gear.

55:22.583 --> 55:23.625
Fuck!

55:28.291 --> 55:30.083
Fucking bastards!

55:36.375 --> 55:37.833
You like that, cunt?

55:41.250 --> 55:44.458
You're so fucking tough? Fucking pigs!

55:46.916 --> 55:48.000
Come on! Shit!

55:48.083 --> 55:49.958
Fuck me. Pull over.

55:52.833 --> 55:54.041
You like that?

55:54.125 --> 55:57.750
"Get out. Show me your hands."
That shit again?

55:58.500 --> 56:00.916
Fucking pigs. Open up!

56:01.458 --> 56:03.125
I said, open up!

56:04.041 --> 56:05.416
Open!

56:08.250 --> 56:11.041
You'll take me for 48 hours
and get jack shit from me.

56:11.125 --> 56:14.583
How about we talk
in a friendlier atmosphere?

56:14.666 --> 56:16.166
Don't fucking try it.

56:16.666 --> 56:18.541
I see you're hungry.

56:19.041 --> 56:20.125
And thirsty.

56:20.625 --> 56:23.666
And I'll be more talkative.

56:24.166 --> 56:25.125
On me.

56:28.125 --> 56:31.208
-Jacek!
-All right, Marcin. Lead the way.

56:42.875 --> 56:43.875
Jacek.

56:49.333 --> 56:52.208
Here, have a fucking drink.

56:55.583 --> 56:58.750
Trust me. It will get better.

57:07.791 --> 57:08.958
Anything else?

57:14.458 --> 57:15.791
I…

57:16.416 --> 57:18.083
can't eat meat.

57:18.750 --> 57:22.958
My cholesterol and TG are too high.

57:26.125 --> 57:29.125
And I'm allergic

57:29.833 --> 57:30.833
to pigs.

57:30.916 --> 57:36.333
But Chief Inspector Bauer
already knows that.

57:36.958 --> 57:39.541
I do know that you're allergic to us.

57:40.250 --> 57:46.291
I also know that allergy will end
in anaphylaxis on some beautiful,

57:46.958 --> 57:48.375
sunny day.

57:49.875 --> 57:51.291
You want to report this?

57:59.333 --> 58:00.250
Fuck off.

58:08.166 --> 58:10.125
I'll still get you, fucker.

58:12.708 --> 58:14.958
Which side are you on?

58:16.041 --> 58:17.000
The law?

58:18.000 --> 58:21.333
You fucking saw them attack me
after Kaszub's funeral.

58:21.416 --> 58:26.291
Golden and that doctor of yours.
They pulled blades on me.

58:26.375 --> 58:29.166
You made no arrests after that.

58:29.250 --> 58:31.583
-Because you're just like us.
-Fuck, Marcin--

58:31.666 --> 58:34.625
-From the same neighborhood.
-I don't give a shit.

58:34.708 --> 58:37.250
Seriously. Fuck, you're wasting my time.

58:37.333 --> 58:40.208
You have me walking
three fucking flights of stairs.

58:40.291 --> 58:43.666
I'll personally see that you're locked up
for exactly 48 hours.

58:43.750 --> 58:47.666
My people are downstairs.
Either give me something or we're done…

58:49.250 --> 58:50.916
with this fucking chit-chat.

58:54.083 --> 58:55.416
Fuck!

58:57.666 --> 59:00.791
Who do you think gained the most
after Polański's death? Not me.

59:03.291 --> 59:07.625
Fuck, I thought
you're fucking brighter than this.

59:13.750 --> 59:16.250
THEY RAIDED ANOTHER WAREHOUSE.
BRING THE CREW!

59:16.333 --> 59:17.166
Fuck!

59:18.833 --> 59:20.916
There will be no dessert! Fuck off!

59:21.000 --> 59:25.250
Go on, arrest me.
You won't stop the war in the city.

59:28.083 --> 59:29.333
Please excuse me.

59:29.416 --> 59:32.708
I have to go. Business calls.

59:32.791 --> 59:33.875
Fuck it.

59:33.958 --> 59:35.916
Fucking transport.

59:36.750 --> 59:40.958
Of rhubarb and cherries.
From Złocieniec to Machów.

59:41.041 --> 59:43.333
It turns out I fucking have to go.

59:43.416 --> 59:45.750
This one time, Dzika.

59:45.833 --> 59:50.166
I'll ignore the fact
that you didn't tell me something.

59:50.250 --> 59:52.916
But next time, I'll kick you the fuck out.

59:59.916 --> 01:00:01.583
There are two pigs upstairs.

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:04.791
Let's get the gear.

01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:07.583
We're going to Dublin, today.

01:00:11.916 --> 01:00:14.166
Welcome! Come on!

01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:18.916
-Fucking Buła.
-Eat up!

01:00:22.666 --> 01:00:24.333
-Wassup?
-'Sup?

01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:40.000
You're here.

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:41.208
One, two, three!

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.833
-Where are the toys?
-Mrówka's here?

01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:47.583
Dzika's been on their asses
since Polański's death.

01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:51.041
They locked them up for 48 hours.
Mrówka might be one of them.

01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:54.291
-Don't say he's not here.
-Fuck knows.

01:00:55.833 --> 01:00:56.916
See?

01:01:03.583 --> 01:01:05.291
-He's here!
-He's here.

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:09.500
Here he is! The word became flesh!

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:19.375
Do you fucking know what you're doing?
This is my territory!

01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:21.041
Drugs ain't hooliganism.

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:22.583
My little Mrówka!

01:01:22.666 --> 01:01:25.750
We always had more people
than you in this place.

01:01:25.833 --> 01:01:27.750
I only take what is mine.

01:01:28.291 --> 01:01:29.125
And you, Zeta…

01:01:30.458 --> 01:01:32.375
I'll find you in the fucking crowd.

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.208
We'll fucking see.

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:46.000
We are making history.

01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:47.583
Others have to wait for it.

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:40.416
Let's fucking go!

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.083
Fuck! Come on!

01:02:49.916 --> 01:02:51.083
Golden!

01:02:59.416 --> 01:03:01.041
Braveheart!

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:10.125
Fuck, try it now!

01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:18.625
I trusted you. Die!

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:26.833
Get back to the kennel!

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:46.375
-Fall back! Fuck!
-They're running away. After them!

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:47.500
Get the fuck out!

01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:56.208
Fuck!

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.833
Pigs.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:14.875
We're out of here!

01:04:40.291 --> 01:04:43.916
Fuck! The pigs are coming! Hurry!

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.208
Fuck it, we're leaving. Get the gear.

01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:47.791
I'll kill you back home.

01:04:47.875 --> 01:04:49.375
-Or I'll kill you.
-Fucking…

01:04:49.458 --> 01:04:51.083
There's always another option.

01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:55.333
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Get the fucking pitchfork!

01:04:55.416 --> 01:04:57.333
Pick up the fucking gear!

01:04:57.416 --> 01:04:59.125
-Fucking run!
-Let's split!

01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:02.875
-For Scotland!
-Furioza!

01:05:35.375 --> 01:05:37.375
KASZUB
YOU'RE A LEGEND

01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:06.416
Mom…

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:30.666
How did you know, Mom? You're the best!

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:33.458
The best!

01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:39.000
The best! No one makes them like you.

01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:40.916
No one! Not even Auntie.

01:06:41.666 --> 01:06:43.041
What's the matter?

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.416
I recorded the news.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.708
A group of masked hooligans
faced off in Dublin.

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:52.958
It is suspected that it was
an encounter between Polish gangs.

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:58.625
The victim is a 33-year-old Zenon K.,
a hooligan wanted by the Polish police.

01:06:58.708 --> 01:07:00.916
The Irish police refuse--

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:05.291
You had such nice, curly hair.

01:07:10.416 --> 01:07:15.041
Mom, I'm in the big leagues now, like Dad.

01:07:16.041 --> 01:07:18.375
Not even that! It's the Champions League!

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:22.833
I saw you all recently,
going to Kaszub's funeral.

01:07:22.916 --> 01:07:25.791
Mom! It's my life.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.208
I told you many times.

01:07:27.291 --> 01:07:31.875
We, football fans, pursue happiness,
and the law pursues us.

01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:36.166
Mommy.

01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:41.250
I'm in love.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.458
Krzysio…

01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:51.791
Hi.

01:08:55.833 --> 01:08:57.291
Girls, come.

01:08:57.375 --> 01:08:58.708
Come, girls.

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:04.208
-You're that Golden?
-Yes.

01:09:04.291 --> 01:09:05.750
Warm up, please.

01:09:06.333 --> 01:09:08.750
-In the middle.
-Tell me what's all this about.

01:09:08.833 --> 01:09:10.708
You can enroll in the class.

01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:13.750
You want me to be
a leaf falling from a tree?

01:09:13.833 --> 01:09:16.791
You can enroll in a group,
but you can't come here.

01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:19.375
-You can't give me such gifts.
-What gifts?

01:09:19.458 --> 01:09:20.541
Real ones.

01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:22.583
You want knock-offs?

01:09:22.666 --> 01:09:24.875
No, but they're worth 100 thousand.

01:09:24.958 --> 01:09:28.500
No, 150 thousand.
I bought them wholesale, with a discount.

01:09:28.583 --> 01:09:31.250
-Will you marry me?
-It's not funny.

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:35.791
-Take them.
-I won't. Unless you go out with me.

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:37.791
Fuck!

01:09:37.875 --> 01:09:39.833
Teacher said "fuck!"

01:09:39.916 --> 01:09:42.208
You can't say "fuck" here.

01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:44.166
You can't say "fuck."

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:46.958
I have a boyfriend.

01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:50.625
Take him with you. I'm not jealous yet.

01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:52.875
Go out with him, miss!

01:09:52.958 --> 01:09:54.541
-No.
-Please!

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:55.625
-No?
-No.

01:09:55.708 --> 01:09:56.583
-No?
-No.

01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:57.541
-No!
-No.

01:09:57.625 --> 01:09:58.666
-No?
-No.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.291
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

01:10:00.375 --> 01:10:01.708
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:03.000
-No?
-No.

01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:05.208
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

01:10:05.291 --> 01:10:06.250
No?

01:10:14.958 --> 01:10:17.041
Your father wouldn't be pleased.

01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:18.666
That I'm like him?

01:10:20.958 --> 01:10:21.875
Will they kick me out?

01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:28.750
Did you fuck him up?

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:31.500
Madam Principal, I am a very busy person.

01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:35.166
I didn't pick this high school
for our son to be in danger.

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:39.291
This might be
the most expensive school in the country.

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:42.458
We expect responsible education, and not…

01:10:42.541 --> 01:10:44.875
-Pathology.
-Pathointellectuals like you?

01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:46.041
Excuse me.

01:10:48.833 --> 01:10:49.750
And you are?

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:51.958
Zuzia's family.

01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:54.333
Yes, this is Zuzia's family.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:58.208
Madam Principal, my niece
has been through a lot recently.

01:10:58.291 --> 01:11:02.083
As a doctor, I can say that she has
many symptoms of PTSD.

01:11:02.166 --> 01:11:03.875
Zuzia's Dad had an accident.

01:11:03.958 --> 01:11:05.708
So you can understand her reaction.

01:11:05.791 --> 01:11:08.833
I keep telling her
that fighting is not okay.

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:11.500
-Come on, Zuzia.
-I'm sorry.

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.000
Pussy.

01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:16.583
Even if a poorly raised classmate

01:11:16.666 --> 01:11:19.416
is calling her father
a thug and a criminal.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
-Jesus.
-He was an honest and honorable hooligan.

01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:28.375
Yeah. And, as we know,
plenty of sociological studies…

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:29.625
May I?

01:11:29.708 --> 01:11:35.166
…prove that children learn from
and imitate them parents.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:37.916
"Their"?

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.250
-You threw a hook?
-I kicked him.

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:45.375
Kicked him? Why you…
Starting today, you go to all classes.

01:11:45.458 --> 01:11:47.166
-Of course.
-Yes, of course.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:49.916
-Don't hit anyone.
-No, it hurts!

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.458
Come here, you devil. Ouch, it hurts!

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:54.583
Why is he staring at himself?

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:57.750
I don't know. He killed!

01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:01.458
The painter. It's a self-portrait.
We're studying it.

01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:04.250
-What happened to him?
-Google it.

01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:05.500
Come.

01:12:07.416 --> 01:12:08.375
Fucking awesome.

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:10.416
A WILD PIG IS STILL A BITCH

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:13.416
Check it out, Dzika.

01:12:15.083 --> 01:12:17.125
The foreigners have arrived.

01:12:22.666 --> 01:12:24.208
Yeah, hello.

01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:27.291
You too, yeah.

01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:53.958
Because…

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:56.041
Chuligani…

01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:58.208
don't work with policja.

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:13.875
Tell him the Americano is for him.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.166
Yeah.

01:13:37.166 --> 01:13:39.666
How do you say "serial widlarz"?

01:13:58.208 --> 01:14:00.416
Mr. Superintendent, I assure you

01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:03.875
that we have
extensive operational knowledge,

01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:06.583
but this is not the time to share it.

01:14:06.666 --> 01:14:09.708
And the second thing, we have suspects.

01:14:09.791 --> 01:14:13.500
As soon as some facts come together…

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:19.416
Fucking comes to my country
and demands to speak in his language.

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:22.291
That's what I wanted to say,
but I don't know…

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.250
Yo, is English yours?

01:15:00.541 --> 01:15:02.750
And piss them off occasionally,
for good measure.

01:15:47.666 --> 01:15:49.750
-I think this one.
-Let me see.

01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:51.583
It's all right.

01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:54.583
-Maybe this one?
-No.

01:15:55.416 --> 01:15:56.458
This one too.

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.583
And me, as a bonus.

01:16:03.083 --> 01:16:07.125
I have a date today,
but not with you, honey.

01:16:57.458 --> 01:16:58.708
Good morning.

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:03.625
It's still waiting for you.

01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:04.875
Don't piss me off.

01:17:06.333 --> 01:17:07.666
Hi, Golden.

01:17:19.208 --> 01:17:21.125
What a place you picked.

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:38.458
So what's the deal with that leaf thing?

01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:40.416
People come to you,

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:45.416
you tell them to swing, they make
fools of themselves, and pay you?

01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:05.500
-Come on, everyone's staring.
-No one's here. Just you.

01:18:11.291 --> 01:18:14.625
-I'm supposed to be a fucking leaf?
-If you want.

01:18:15.416 --> 01:18:16.916
As long as you feel it.

01:18:17.833 --> 01:18:20.625
You're alone with yourself. Here and now.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.583
You shake off your problems.

01:18:25.833 --> 01:18:26.916
You feel calm.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.750
That's embarrassing. God.

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:33.250
There's nothing except you.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.458
You just are.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.375
Right. That's cringy.

01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:46.000
I'll take you to a club.
That's where you can dance.

01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:49.083
Wait, my backpack.

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:15.333
May I?

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:21.333
This is where you dance.

01:19:22.416 --> 01:19:23.458
Yeah?

01:19:26.125 --> 01:19:27.166
Oh, you…

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.500
You want it?

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:38.041
I'll buy you this sea.

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:46.625
You can't buy the sea, baldy.

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:54.833
Stop!

01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:57.166
What?

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:41.916
Hey…

01:23:47.208 --> 01:23:50.666
-I have to go to the school.
-School? How old are you?

01:23:52.583 --> 01:23:55.041
I run classes there.

01:23:56.833 --> 01:23:58.416
Don't leave…

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.166
Don't. Leaf.

01:24:02.708 --> 01:24:03.791
Come.

01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:11.958
I haven't slept this well in a long time.

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:17.500
I wanted to do it, and I did it.

01:24:18.958 --> 01:24:20.000
But just once.

01:24:20.583 --> 01:24:21.500
No.

01:24:22.833 --> 01:24:24.541
A couple of times.

01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:28.250
Yesterday. That was a one-time thing.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.458
Police! Hands on the glass!

01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:54.958
-Get out!
-Then open the fucking door!

01:24:55.041 --> 01:24:58.000
Easy! Fuck!

01:24:58.083 --> 01:25:00.166
-Enough already.
-All right.

01:25:01.875 --> 01:25:05.333
When Polański went missing,
you were buying caustic soda.

01:25:05.416 --> 01:25:07.458
Fuck! I'm going!

01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:11.416
You want to be a thug? Fine.
You'll spend 48 hours in a cell.

01:25:18.583 --> 01:25:20.583
-Finally, for fuck's sake.
-Sorry.

01:25:21.166 --> 01:25:23.291
I can't reach anyone.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.958
Krzywy, Dawid, Jezusek.
Did they shit their pants?

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:30.541
All right, let's go.

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:32.666
-I shit myself once.
-To the car park.

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:35.750
There's nothing you can do, Olo.

01:25:35.833 --> 01:25:36.958
Buła.

01:25:42.208 --> 01:25:43.291
Fuck.

01:25:45.833 --> 01:25:46.833
Fuck, look at this.

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:50.458
What do we do?

01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:55.041
Fuck it. We can do it ourselves.

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:02.375
Easy.

01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:08.500
Fuck. Across a church. Perfect.

01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:10.875
GOD IS WAITING FOR YOU

01:26:21.208 --> 01:26:22.916
And a fuckload of people.

01:26:29.416 --> 01:26:30.416
It's him.

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:32.958
Hello.

01:26:34.416 --> 01:26:35.708
Oh, hi!

01:26:35.791 --> 01:26:37.083
Go.

01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:42.166
-What?
-There's a hole in the roof.

01:26:43.125 --> 01:26:45.041
Hey! Fucking go.

01:26:46.083 --> 01:26:47.125
Fuck!

01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:50.000
Go home.

01:26:57.333 --> 01:26:59.166
-Fuck!
-What the fuck?

01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:01.000
Fuck, Buła! Not yet!

01:27:01.625 --> 01:27:03.000
Get down! Down!

01:27:04.166 --> 01:27:05.041
Fuck!

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:07.166
Fuck, don't get up!

01:27:08.416 --> 01:27:09.250
Back up!

01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:11.375
Back up!

01:27:12.708 --> 01:27:13.625
Fuck!

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:15.291
Fuck!

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.875
Go!

01:27:23.458 --> 01:27:24.833
Don't get up!

01:27:27.541 --> 01:27:31.583
Come back, Olo! Fuck! He's shot!

01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:33.166
Fuck!

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:35.875
-Fuck!
-Wait.

01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:37.916
Olo!

01:27:38.583 --> 01:27:40.291
Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:43.083
Olo! Behind the black one!

01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:45.458
He hid behind the black one!

01:27:47.333 --> 01:27:48.291
Fuck!

01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:50.416
-Fuck.
-Fuck!

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:54.500
Fucking Furioza faggots!

01:27:54.583 --> 01:27:58.083
-Let's get the fuck out!
-Not brave enough to use your fists?

01:27:58.166 --> 01:28:01.416
All right, we can have a fucking shootout!

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.958
Go!

01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:09.750
-Oh, fuck!
-Buła!

01:28:10.916 --> 01:28:13.208
-Come on!
-Buła!

01:28:14.291 --> 01:28:16.625
Go!

01:28:21.166 --> 01:28:25.000
You were supposed to wait
for me to shoot first, for fuck's sake!

01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:29.416
I told you to fucking focus, Buła!
And you're eating fucking donuts!

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.166
And thinking about fuck knows what!

01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:37.458
Now we're driving across fucking Tricity
with a broken window and neck wounds.

01:28:51.958 --> 01:28:54.166
The weapon is on the back seat.

01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:15.125
All right.

01:29:52.666 --> 01:29:54.125
Come with me.

01:29:54.208 --> 01:29:57.958
Please, I can't take it anymore.
Eli, I love you. I'll always…

01:29:58.708 --> 01:29:59.875
love you.

01:29:59.958 --> 01:30:02.208
Come, or I'll lose my mind.

01:30:08.166 --> 01:30:09.125
Come on.

01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:11.416
When I was eight,

01:30:12.208 --> 01:30:14.750
my mother sent me to a boarding school.

01:30:20.375 --> 01:30:25.083
I was a child. In a foreign place.
I missed her, I cried.

01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:33.416
I thought, if I become the best,
if I make it, she will love me.

01:30:34.166 --> 01:30:36.333
She'll finally care about me.

01:30:36.416 --> 01:30:39.916
And do you know what she said
after my Swan Lake premiere?

01:30:41.625 --> 01:30:43.416
"You missed the fouetté."

01:30:49.416 --> 01:30:52.166
-Well, did you?
-Fuck you, that's not the point.

01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:53.666
And I can play the bagpipes.

01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:54.958
-What?
-Listen.

01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:56.333
-What?
-Close your eyes.

01:30:56.416 --> 01:30:58.666
-I want to see.
-Close. No peeking.

01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:00.500
-All right.
-No peeking.

01:31:00.583 --> 01:31:01.750
Play the bagpipes!

01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:05.541
Quiet!

01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:08.708
What?

01:31:10.375 --> 01:31:11.625
How do you…

01:31:15.416 --> 01:31:17.166
I won't be your girlfriend, Golden.

01:31:17.875 --> 01:31:21.000
We can meet, we can shag,
but under my rules.

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:22.500
Hey.

01:31:23.208 --> 01:31:24.541
I want to be independent.

01:31:25.041 --> 01:31:27.458
And if I leave, I leave.
You'll let me do it.

01:31:40.125 --> 01:31:41.333
What's up, dude?

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.333
Jimmy.

01:31:48.208 --> 01:31:49.666
Put him on speaker.

01:31:54.458 --> 01:31:57.166
Kurwa, easy, buddy.

01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:09.666
Fuck! Take it!

01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:13.125
Get all this shit off me! Fuck it all!

01:32:13.208 --> 01:32:15.000
Get my fucking clothes!

01:32:39.083 --> 01:32:40.500
Golden, for fuck's sake.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.625
Are we killing each other
or talking about money?

01:32:53.541 --> 01:32:54.458
What the fuck?

01:32:54.541 --> 01:33:00.208
Leave him! Fuck! Get the fuck off him!

01:33:07.875 --> 01:33:10.416
Come on.

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:18.458
No. On "three."

01:33:19.666 --> 01:33:21.291
One, two…

01:33:21.375 --> 01:33:22.916
and three!

01:33:31.666 --> 01:33:32.708
All right.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.125
We can do this deal together.

01:33:37.125 --> 01:33:39.291
But we won't be friends.

01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:45.125
I have a system for distributing
our product on The Islands.

01:33:45.208 --> 01:33:49.833
As long as it works,
we can conquer Ireland.

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:54.125
Our fucking Polish pigs
can kiss our asses.

01:33:56.666 --> 01:33:59.791
But it needs to be quiet in the city.
We have to stop fighting.

01:33:59.875 --> 01:34:02.583
We either all kill each other,
or they will arrest us.

01:34:03.166 --> 01:34:08.375
Big money likes quiet. Quiet on its turf.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.541
No. Fuck no.

01:34:18.625 --> 01:34:21.125
Krzywy.

01:34:21.625 --> 01:34:24.041
People keep talking about
a score of a lifetime.

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:25.708
Supposedly, it was a myth.

01:34:25.791 --> 01:34:29.500
But it's happening.
Here and now. This is our shot.

01:34:34.166 --> 01:34:36.083
We all promised to avenge Kaszub.

01:34:36.166 --> 01:34:38.458
-I know.
-And you wanna make deals with Mrówa?

01:34:38.541 --> 01:34:40.541
-You think I let that go?
-Didn't you?

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:45.791
In time, we'll deal with Mrówka.
Same as we dealt with Polański.

01:34:45.875 --> 01:34:47.250
Okay. When?

01:34:47.333 --> 01:34:49.916
I don't fucking know! Just wait.

01:34:52.083 --> 01:34:55.458
Mrówka's Irish buddy
is controlling the port.

01:34:58.125 --> 01:35:00.250
We'll have a problem with Olo and Dawid.

01:35:10.958 --> 01:35:12.208
Do you see something?

01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:18.583
-Do you see what they're saying?
-I don't understand.

01:35:21.541 --> 01:35:23.833
Focus!

01:35:32.041 --> 01:35:36.875
"I have two tickets
for a U2 concert in Dublin."

01:35:43.166 --> 01:35:48.000
Hey, Golden!
What the fuck is up with this country?

01:35:48.583 --> 01:35:50.666
It always rains, it's cold.

01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:53.625
-Here.
-But they have the best kebab.

01:35:55.958 --> 01:35:58.291
I waited half an hour,
but it was worth it.

01:35:58.375 --> 01:36:01.375
Watch out. The first shot is crucial.

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:05.958
Let's give him a line.

01:36:06.041 --> 01:36:07.125
He got his!

01:36:39.833 --> 01:36:42.583
Golden, those are fucking clans.

01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:48.791
They are like a family,
and family is important!

01:36:57.166 --> 01:36:58.541
Come on!

01:37:07.583 --> 01:37:09.500
Stop this fucking rain.

01:37:10.666 --> 01:37:11.500
Fuck, kurwa!

01:37:14.458 --> 01:37:16.791
It's fucking zimna!

01:37:16.875 --> 01:37:20.750
Fuck, Golden!
If you want to earn the money, shut up!

01:37:29.416 --> 01:37:31.208
-What?
-Fucking double!

01:37:31.291 --> 01:37:33.041
He wants twice as much marijuana!

01:37:33.125 --> 01:37:36.333
I told you, Polish pigs
can kiss our asses!

01:37:57.875 --> 01:37:59.625
Fuck, it's so cold!

01:37:59.708 --> 01:38:01.791
Oh, yes!

01:38:08.208 --> 01:38:11.291
Yes.

01:38:13.333 --> 01:38:15.583
Golden and Mrówka.

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:20.125
Dempsey and Makepeace on the case!

01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:24.083
-Such good lads.
-Don't stop!

01:38:24.166 --> 01:38:26.583
Save for the fact
that you're fucking thugs.

01:38:26.666 --> 01:38:29.541
Now, as I hear, working internationally.

01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:36.416
At 4:30 p.m. you have
a police supervision hearing in court.

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.375
Fuck!

01:38:39.208 --> 01:38:42.291
Even if you don't show up,
it will still be in effect. Twice a week.

01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:45.625
-For both of you. Starting today.
-No more flying.

01:38:45.708 --> 01:38:47.875
No U2 concerts in Dublin.

01:38:47.958 --> 01:38:50.208
And it's not the same
without Larry on drums.

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:51.708
Stop it, Jacek!

01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:56.208
And if you do go, you won't come back.
Or come back straight to jail.

01:38:57.791 --> 01:39:00.583
Who the fuck are you doing business with?

01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:05.375
Come on, Dzika.

01:39:05.458 --> 01:39:06.916
-Dzika…
-We're leaving.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.416
How's your mom?

01:39:09.375 --> 01:39:13.041
Has she met
all your ballet dancers and Thai girls?

01:39:13.916 --> 01:39:17.000
I saw her recently. She was sad.

01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:28.583
Fuck!

01:39:34.416 --> 01:39:35.458
Massage!

01:39:42.041 --> 01:39:44.875
-What a tragedy!
-Such an explosion!

01:39:44.958 --> 01:39:51.416
Such a deafening explosion!
I only heard a fucking bang!

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:55.291
The roof fell on our heads!
I can't hear anything!

01:39:55.375 --> 01:39:59.416
Huge fucking explosion!

01:39:59.958 --> 01:40:01.875
Marcin Mrówczyński, supervision.

01:40:01.958 --> 01:40:03.583
Fuck the police!

01:40:06.291 --> 01:40:07.916
Golden!

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.208
Here's the golden child
of Polish hooligans.

01:40:11.291 --> 01:40:14.208
Come, we can park you by the bike stands!

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:16.875
We're filming a show!

01:40:18.833 --> 01:40:20.375
Just needs a gold carpet.

01:40:20.458 --> 01:40:25.583
-Good morning.
-Morning! I'm here for supervision!

01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:29.166
-That's right.
-Supervision!

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:37.583
I bought it.

01:40:40.875 --> 01:40:42.666
And now I'll live here.

01:40:44.958 --> 01:40:47.958
And, if you want,

01:40:48.791 --> 01:40:51.041
you can live here too. Do you want to?

01:40:51.583 --> 01:40:52.791
Live with me, Leafy.

01:40:52.875 --> 01:40:55.791
The sea is right behind the dunes.
150 feet from here.

01:40:58.125 --> 01:41:00.666
The sea you said cannot be bought.

01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:03.125
But I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:41:03.708 --> 01:41:05.208
You're hopeless.

01:41:07.166 --> 01:41:08.708
-Golden!
-Huh?

01:41:08.791 --> 01:41:12.208
-Why is he staring at himself like that?
-Fuck off, Sylwek.

01:41:12.958 --> 01:41:14.041
Go!

01:41:15.958 --> 01:41:17.833
Chop, chop!

01:41:17.916 --> 01:41:20.375
The door. And don't come back!

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:30.291
-I don't want to do it like that.
-I want to.

01:41:30.375 --> 01:41:31.666
-Not anymore.
-Stop.

01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:33.666
-Are you here?
-I am.

01:41:34.375 --> 01:41:36.958
-You're not here.
-I am.

01:41:37.916 --> 01:41:40.166
Where? You're not here.

01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:41.583
Stop it. I'm here.

01:41:41.666 --> 01:41:43.333
Be here with me.

01:41:44.583 --> 01:41:45.916
-Eli…
-You're not here.

01:41:58.291 --> 01:42:00.333
Let the wind take you.

01:42:01.875 --> 01:42:03.291
What are you doing?

01:42:04.458 --> 01:42:07.041
Come here!

01:42:08.458 --> 01:42:11.541
Let the wind take you. Take it easy.

01:42:12.958 --> 01:42:14.000
Can I?

01:42:37.375 --> 01:42:38.333
Yes?

01:42:42.083 --> 01:42:43.041
Yes?

01:42:44.666 --> 01:42:46.208
-Yes?
-Be here with me.

01:42:46.291 --> 01:42:47.291
I'm here.

01:42:48.083 --> 01:42:50.000
Be with me for real.

01:43:19.916 --> 01:43:21.375
Golden…

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.208
I don't really know you.

01:43:29.166 --> 01:43:30.625
What do you want?

01:43:36.166 --> 01:43:38.000
I want to go back in time.

01:43:50.250 --> 01:43:51.250
-What?
-Watch out!

01:43:51.333 --> 01:43:52.958
No, stop!

01:43:53.541 --> 01:43:54.666
What the…

01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:56.250
-I'm buckling up.
-You?

01:43:56.333 --> 01:43:57.666
-Yes.
-What the hell?

01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:59.583
-Both hands…
-I know how to drive!

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:01.875
-Fuck! Yeah, right!
-It's not my first time.

01:44:01.958 --> 01:44:04.000
-Which one? Second!
-Second.

01:44:04.083 --> 01:44:05.416
Can you check the mirrors?

01:44:07.625 --> 01:44:09.666
Your dad would be proud.

01:44:11.416 --> 01:44:12.375
Everything okay?

01:44:13.083 --> 01:44:14.500
Uncle, everything okay?

01:44:24.083 --> 01:44:25.208
What's up, Krzywy?

01:44:25.291 --> 01:44:27.791
Check it out.
Hold on, I'll switch the camera.

01:44:28.583 --> 01:44:31.250
See it? We're changing micro…

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.083
into macro.

01:44:34.166 --> 01:44:36.208
I set everything up. Perfect operation.

01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:38.333
Right, I'm off.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.833
MILKY WAY
EVERY DAY STARTS WITH MILK!

01:44:47.875 --> 01:44:48.708
Kawa?

01:44:49.791 --> 01:44:51.583
Not too early for coffee with whisky?

01:44:54.833 --> 01:44:56.791
I need a receipt, kurwa.

01:44:57.375 --> 01:44:59.375
No, he don't give me, so how I can take?

01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:06.750
Beautiful!

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:16.250
-I don't have that much cash on me.
-Do you have a card?

01:45:32.541 --> 01:45:33.833
What's up?

01:45:33.916 --> 01:45:35.583
-They uploaded a new video.
-Yeah?

01:45:36.416 --> 01:45:39.333
-Reached 420,000 views in two days.
-Golden!

01:45:39.416 --> 01:45:41.791
-You don't say!
-Left jab!

01:45:43.916 --> 01:45:46.958
I'm here for my supervision!

01:45:47.041 --> 01:45:49.500
Messi, watch the chassis!

01:45:51.208 --> 01:45:53.625
-Oh, that's our station, boss!
-Yeah.

01:45:54.958 --> 01:45:56.250
And this one?

01:45:56.333 --> 01:45:57.750
-Almost a million.
-Yeah.

01:45:57.833 --> 01:45:58.958
Give me a ticket…

01:45:59.041 --> 01:46:01.208
Makes you think, huh?

01:46:01.291 --> 01:46:05.208
Should you be happy or fucking proud, huh?

01:46:05.291 --> 01:46:06.833
What is this?

01:46:07.958 --> 01:46:08.875
Huh?

01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:12.250
This is a fucking laughingstock…
Yeah, run away.

01:46:12.333 --> 01:46:15.041
You want to know what this is?
I'll fucking tell you.

01:46:15.125 --> 01:46:18.416
Idiots, they're making
a laughingstock of our justice system!

01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:21.375
Meaning fucking you, moron, and you, fool,

01:46:21.458 --> 01:46:24.291
and you, clown, and fucking me!

01:46:24.375 --> 01:46:29.333
And what, we can't find anything
on those fucking idiots?

01:46:29.416 --> 01:46:32.041
Fucking shit! Nothing?

01:46:32.125 --> 01:46:33.250
Fuck it.

01:46:39.125 --> 01:46:44.083
Will someone here
start fucking working or not?

01:46:45.958 --> 01:46:49.750
The market value is lower
than what my client offers.

01:46:50.625 --> 01:46:51.458
This page…

01:46:51.541 --> 01:46:53.416
-Everything checks out?
-Yes.

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.000
So what's taking so long?

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.125
Are you a lawyer or a pussy?
What do I fucking pay you for?

01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:03.458
You have five seconds.
Fucking sign it. Five…

01:47:03.541 --> 01:47:06.041
four, three…

01:47:06.125 --> 01:47:09.458
And that's a goal! Fucking awesome!

01:47:09.541 --> 01:47:10.833
Here you go.

01:47:25.791 --> 01:47:27.583
I just bought this place.

01:47:30.041 --> 01:47:32.750
So you don't have
to pay rent to that prick.

01:47:33.333 --> 01:47:34.750
You did what?

01:47:37.666 --> 01:47:41.583
I created that school myself. It was mine.

01:47:41.666 --> 01:47:44.666
I love being independent.
You want to take that away from me?

01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:46.750
I don't want to take anything away.

01:47:46.833 --> 01:47:49.500
Fuck, I bought the place
and I want to give it to you.

01:47:49.583 --> 01:47:52.041
I don't want your money!
Don't you understand?

01:47:52.125 --> 01:47:55.041
We had a deal. No commitments!

01:47:55.125 --> 01:47:57.875
Fine. How much was your rent?

01:47:57.958 --> 01:48:00.333
-4500.
-So you'll pay me too.

01:48:01.291 --> 01:48:02.125
500 zlotys.

01:48:02.208 --> 01:48:04.083
You don't get it! At least 5000.

01:48:04.708 --> 01:48:06.333
-1500.
-5500.

01:48:06.416 --> 01:48:07.375
-2500.
-6000.

01:48:07.458 --> 01:48:08.333
-What?!
-Seven!

01:48:08.416 --> 01:48:09.416
-3000.
-7500.

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:10.500
-3500.
-9000.

01:48:10.583 --> 01:48:12.708
-4000. Stop it! All right!
-10 000.

01:48:13.666 --> 01:48:16.916
4500. Like it was. Deal?

01:48:18.583 --> 01:48:21.666
Rent's due the fifth of every month.
In advance.

01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:24.583
-Golden, I'm being serious.
-Me too.

01:48:25.375 --> 01:48:27.500
I'm going to Dublin. You want something?

01:48:29.166 --> 01:48:30.833
Fuck off!

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:42.791
-Mróweczka?
-Fuck!

01:48:42.875 --> 01:48:45.291
-Mróweczka!
-No more fucking supervision!

01:48:45.375 --> 01:48:47.916
You're here! Fucking pigs!

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.750
-I have a little surprise for you.
-I like surprises.

01:48:50.833 --> 01:48:51.916
-Come.
-Please.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.291
Ms. Janeczka, lower prices,
like back home, in Poland.

01:48:55.375 --> 01:48:56.958
-Jimmy!
-You'll pay for that.

01:49:05.583 --> 01:49:06.416
Mróweczka.

01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:11.208
My little man!

01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:13.208
Fuck, come here!

01:49:14.208 --> 01:49:15.583
Let's talk.

01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:22.166
-So? How was it?
-Pigs are the same all over the world.

01:49:22.666 --> 01:49:25.791
Yeah. And did anyone rat?

01:49:26.375 --> 01:49:27.500
Of course not.

01:49:28.833 --> 01:49:30.041
You sure?

01:49:30.666 --> 01:49:31.958
Everything's cool.

01:49:32.041 --> 01:49:35.541
-And thank you for the lawyer and stuff.
-I take care of my men.

01:49:35.625 --> 01:49:37.833
How are your broken fingies?

01:49:37.916 --> 01:49:41.041
-They will heal in no time.
-Fuck!

01:49:48.041 --> 01:49:49.250
Fuck!

01:50:08.666 --> 01:50:10.041
What the fuck is he saying?

01:50:10.125 --> 01:50:11.208
I don't fucking know.

01:50:16.458 --> 01:50:17.791
Fuck!

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.708
Shit, I don't understand. Carlos?

01:50:36.791 --> 01:50:39.958
Jimmy could only sell
our shitty Polish marijuana.

01:50:47.416 --> 01:50:50.125
-Fuck off…
-Shut the fuck up, Carlos!

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.875
-Only wholesale.
-I fucking understand! Wholesale.

01:51:22.625 --> 01:51:25.541
I take it hurtowo… wholesale.

01:51:29.291 --> 01:51:30.125
Fuck…

01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:34.666
Fuck it, we'll take as much as we should.

01:51:35.166 --> 01:51:37.791
Only the brave ones win. And Jimmy's gone.

01:51:37.875 --> 01:51:41.291
Stop it! He's gone
because he was fucking killed by the IRA.

01:51:41.375 --> 01:51:44.208
It's out of our league.
We're not doing this. Get it?

01:51:44.291 --> 01:51:46.000
-Let's at least try it.
-No way.

01:51:46.083 --> 01:51:49.750
Let's try.
It's an awesome product. One sniff!

01:51:50.791 --> 01:51:51.958
Fuck.

01:52:02.291 --> 01:52:03.125
And?

01:52:05.208 --> 01:52:07.541
-Nothing?
-Fuck, nothing at all.

01:52:19.125 --> 01:52:21.416
Fuck, ants are crawling on my head.

01:52:23.458 --> 01:52:26.416
I just spoke with God.
You know what he told me?

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:29.000
"Dilute this in 50/50 proportions,

01:52:29.083 --> 01:52:33.000
sell it, and you'll be made for life."

01:52:33.083 --> 01:52:35.500
-This is what he told me.
-It's the IRA.

01:52:35.583 --> 01:52:37.125
-One deal.
-Are you insane?

01:52:37.208 --> 01:52:39.416
-One deal, Mrówka.
-No fucking deal.

01:52:40.208 --> 01:52:42.958
-Fuck, you can't even sniff it.
-What more do you want?

01:52:44.666 --> 01:52:45.916
What more do I want?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.791
Fuck, I say we can make do
just with MJ here.

01:53:00.875 --> 01:53:02.500
You stay quiet, okay?

01:53:03.083 --> 01:53:04.333
Okay.

01:53:04.416 --> 01:53:07.583
-Fuck, I do the talking!
-Okay, Dad.

01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:15.666
Fuck.

01:53:16.541 --> 01:53:18.875
All right already. Fuck off.

01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:20.333
Enough!

01:53:42.291 --> 01:53:43.666
For fuck's sake.

01:54:24.125 --> 01:54:25.875
-For fuck's sake!
-All right.

01:54:25.958 --> 01:54:27.208
-Fuck!
-Come on.

01:54:27.291 --> 01:54:30.333
Twenty million euros!
I'll fucking kill you!

01:54:30.416 --> 01:54:31.416
You fucking…

01:54:32.208 --> 01:54:33.750
You fucking lunatic!

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:38.833
You're fucking insane. Insane.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.875
You're asking for a lot of money.

01:54:49.541 --> 01:54:51.458
I know your daughter's school.

01:54:51.541 --> 01:54:52.875
Stop fucking yapping!

01:55:03.583 --> 01:55:06.291
-Ten days!
-Ten days! I know!

01:55:13.708 --> 01:55:15.041
For fuck's sake.

01:55:15.791 --> 01:55:19.625
We're still five million euro short. Fuck!

01:55:22.583 --> 01:55:24.458
Fuck me.

01:55:26.291 --> 01:55:28.875
I can't get any more in such short time.

01:55:30.125 --> 01:55:32.750
Why the fuck did I make a deal
with the IRA?

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.333
Fuck, Golden. They'll fucking kill us.
You'll see.

01:56:00.083 --> 01:56:02.250
Golden! Come here!

01:56:09.583 --> 01:56:10.750
Hi.

01:56:36.791 --> 01:56:37.833
How much?

01:56:38.708 --> 01:56:39.916
I have 1.2 million.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.083
Dima. That's not enough.
The lightning has its price.

01:56:44.166 --> 01:56:46.041
It's a fortune for us, Golden.

01:56:46.125 --> 01:56:48.666
A lot of very important people chipped in.

01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:50.708
-Dima.
-What?

01:56:53.291 --> 01:56:54.458
You don't get it.

01:56:55.291 --> 01:56:59.083
You'll end up like your friend.

01:56:59.166 --> 01:57:02.416
Do you fucking get it or not?

01:57:04.416 --> 01:57:05.375
I get it.

01:57:19.625 --> 01:57:21.666
Group together.

01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:25.500
Now, we'll breathe as a group,
as one body.

01:57:27.041 --> 01:57:28.583
Like that.

01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:33.500
Thank you. Class over.

01:57:33.583 --> 01:57:35.958
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-What's going on?

01:57:36.041 --> 01:57:40.166
We'd like to enroll
in some dance classes.

01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:43.500
Something like that.
How much for a lesson?

01:57:43.583 --> 01:57:44.500
Too much.

01:57:45.416 --> 01:57:47.083
Another one of Golden's whores.

01:57:47.166 --> 01:57:49.416
You'd be surprised what we can afford.

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.125
They started paying us overtime.

01:57:52.208 --> 01:57:55.791
And we have a lot of overtime
thanks to the likes of your man.

01:57:55.875 --> 01:58:00.000
We just want to talk.
You may not know who you are dealing with.

01:58:02.625 --> 01:58:03.541
Here it is.

01:58:06.583 --> 01:58:07.791
Sorry.

01:58:11.791 --> 01:58:14.458
-You dance here?
-They do.

01:58:14.541 --> 01:58:20.083
"Eliza Lipińska, 28, engaged…"
I guess that's no longer the case.

01:58:20.166 --> 01:58:23.291
A couple of wins
at the Golden Points tournament.

01:58:23.375 --> 01:58:24.416
"Pointes."

01:58:25.541 --> 01:58:27.333
"Golden Pointes."

01:58:28.833 --> 01:58:34.083
"Szczecin. Tournament. Wojciech Wieś…"

01:58:34.166 --> 01:58:36.416
"Wiesiołłowski." Oh.

01:58:36.916 --> 01:58:39.916
Yeah, a lot of dancing and merriment.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.291
That's all fine and dandy,
but who are you dating?

01:58:44.791 --> 01:58:47.833
Has he charmed you, or just told you lies?

01:58:49.791 --> 01:58:52.166
Right. Start the search with the office.

01:58:52.666 --> 01:58:55.000
They will pick this place apart.

01:58:55.083 --> 01:58:57.708
Now, I can't stop them.
Even if I wanted to.

01:58:57.791 --> 01:59:01.000
The school will be closed
for at least a week.

01:59:01.083 --> 01:59:04.375
If they find anything, maybe forever.

01:59:04.458 --> 01:59:07.041
It's too late for Golden,
but we can still help you.

01:59:08.541 --> 01:59:12.541
I know you're not a part of this world.
You're just with the wrong person.

01:59:13.375 --> 01:59:18.416
A person involved in drug smuggling,
muggings, battery.

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:22.208
It's likely that he killed
a local crime boss

01:59:22.291 --> 01:59:24.500
to get rid of his competition.

01:59:25.666 --> 01:59:29.375
You're a local,
and everyone here knows Polański.

01:59:29.458 --> 01:59:32.833
And everyone knows
that his club now belongs to Golden.

01:59:32.916 --> 01:59:34.375
And you?

01:59:34.458 --> 01:59:39.750
Ms, I mean. You're just
spinning your little pirouettes

01:59:39.833 --> 01:59:43.041
in your fucking pointe-shmointes?

01:59:51.541 --> 01:59:53.000
Fuck!

01:59:55.416 --> 01:59:57.958
I thought you were a simple hooligan.

01:59:58.041 --> 01:59:59.291
Yeah.

01:59:59.875 --> 02:00:01.916
-You're a gangster?
-A what?

02:00:06.416 --> 02:00:08.000
The police came to the school.

02:00:08.083 --> 02:00:09.666
Where did you grow up?

02:00:10.666 --> 02:00:11.958
Pigs lie.

02:00:12.041 --> 02:00:13.958
They said you deal drugs.

02:00:14.041 --> 02:00:19.416
Where's the registration
for that fucking Mercedes?

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.916
-They said…
-Here it is.

02:00:22.625 --> 02:00:24.458
Golden, do you kill people?

02:00:26.583 --> 02:00:27.416
Eli.

02:00:28.208 --> 02:00:30.291
Eli, listen.

02:00:30.375 --> 02:00:31.916
Eli. Leafy!

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.291
Let go of me!

02:00:35.375 --> 02:00:36.333
-Look.
-Let go.

02:00:36.416 --> 02:00:38.583
-I do what I do. I have to end it.
-Let go!

02:00:38.666 --> 02:00:40.000
-I have to end it.
-Let go!

02:00:40.083 --> 02:00:43.708
It's the last thing.
Otherwise, they'll kill me.

02:00:44.208 --> 02:00:45.666
They'll kill me.

02:00:46.583 --> 02:00:47.791
One thing.

02:01:00.125 --> 02:01:01.250
Relax.

02:01:03.875 --> 02:01:06.250
Golden, how much longer will it take?

02:01:06.333 --> 02:01:07.750
-Pick this up.
-What?

02:01:07.833 --> 02:01:09.416
One moment.

02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:11.375
You were supposed to give him to us.

02:01:11.458 --> 02:01:15.250
-It's not the time, my man.
-We were quiet.

02:01:15.333 --> 02:01:17.083
I'm in a hurry. Give that to me.

02:01:17.791 --> 02:01:19.333
I'm in a hurry, gentlemen.

02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:24.416
-Talk to them before they do something.
-Krzywy. Is the crew ready?

02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:26.583
-Yeah.
-Then let's fucking go.

02:01:28.625 --> 02:01:30.208
Come on!

02:01:34.291 --> 02:01:36.583
What's up, dude. Everything good?

02:01:37.958 --> 02:01:39.791
Relax. After the 25th…

02:01:39.875 --> 02:01:42.250
-Wiki! Long time no see!
-Hi, Golden!

02:01:42.333 --> 02:01:44.541
You got swole, dude.

02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:47.708
Tax audit, FBI Furioza!

02:01:49.166 --> 02:01:50.791
I've heard about you.

02:01:51.708 --> 02:01:55.583
I remember your old man in the 90s.
Couldn't catch a cold.

02:01:55.666 --> 02:01:57.250
I did time for Słowik.

02:01:57.333 --> 02:01:59.708
I won't let some cunt…

02:02:03.833 --> 02:02:05.541
I also…

02:02:05.625 --> 02:02:08.666
remember that my old man…

02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:10.958
couldn't catch a cold!

02:02:13.625 --> 02:02:16.791
Well? Can we talk like people?

02:02:16.875 --> 02:02:17.875
What?

02:02:17.958 --> 02:02:22.541
It's your business,
how you make money, gentlemen.

02:02:22.625 --> 02:02:24.666
VAT fraud? Fine, I don't care.

02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:26.333
So what do you want?

02:02:26.416 --> 02:02:29.416
I need to borrow four million euros.
Right now.

02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:32.000
-Four million euros?
-Come on, please.

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:35.458
I could just fucking take
the couple of hundred thousand

02:02:35.541 --> 02:02:37.375
lying on this beautiful table.

02:02:37.458 --> 02:02:41.083
But I like you guys. I respect you.

02:02:41.166 --> 02:02:45.333
I mean, you did time for Słowik!

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.916
So, do whatever you want.
I'll give you protection.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.916
You're untouchable in the Tricity.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.666
Here are the papers
for my real estate, for my cars.

02:02:58.750 --> 02:03:02.708
If my investment tanks,
I'll go down with it. But it's doubtful.

02:03:03.291 --> 02:03:07.041
But you'll get part of your money back.
What do you say?

02:03:07.125 --> 02:03:08.166
Deal done?

02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:10.333
One hour. I'll be here.

02:03:10.875 --> 02:03:13.125
How come he has such a fine chick,

02:03:14.166 --> 02:03:15.500
and I don't?

02:03:17.083 --> 02:03:18.625
All right, focus.

02:03:22.375 --> 02:03:23.750
Fuck!

02:03:25.083 --> 02:03:25.916
Fuck!

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.000
-Come here!
-Fuck!

02:03:29.125 --> 02:03:30.875
-Fucker!
-Come on!

02:03:31.666 --> 02:03:33.625
Come here, cunt!

02:03:33.708 --> 02:03:36.583
I'll fucking kill you! Open up!

02:03:36.666 --> 02:03:38.708
Hey!

02:03:38.791 --> 02:03:41.416
-Get the fuck out!
-Let's bounce!

02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:44.333
Police! Get the fuck out of here!

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:46.250
Get the fuck out!

02:03:48.791 --> 02:03:51.791
Who the fuck
was supposed to guard the area?

02:03:52.375 --> 02:03:53.833
-Which one?
-Fuck, Mrówa.

02:03:53.916 --> 02:03:56.125
-What's happening?
-Call an ambulance!

02:03:56.208 --> 02:03:58.625
-Get a fucking ambulance.
-Towels, now!

02:03:58.708 --> 02:03:59.666
Give me a towel!

02:03:59.750 --> 02:04:02.291
-What the fuck happened?
-What do you think?

02:04:02.375 --> 02:04:04.000
Fuck!

02:04:14.416 --> 02:04:16.208
Golden, did you kill anybody?

02:04:16.291 --> 02:04:17.250
It's not like that.

02:04:19.125 --> 02:04:22.250
They outnumbered the three of us.

02:04:23.083 --> 02:04:26.166
You can get your ass beat,
but you can't give up.

02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:27.333
You have to fight.

02:04:27.416 --> 02:04:29.541
They outnumbered us. Daro pulled a knife.

02:04:30.666 --> 02:04:32.000
They pummeled me so hard.

02:04:32.083 --> 02:04:33.541
What's up now, cunt?

02:04:33.625 --> 02:04:34.666
I barely made it.

02:04:34.750 --> 02:04:38.083
They knocked out my tooth.
Daro was lying in a pool of blood.

02:04:38.708 --> 02:04:41.083
He was bleeding from everywhere.

02:04:41.583 --> 02:04:42.791
Dzika came.

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:45.916
Her screams… I can't forget it.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.041
Daro!

02:04:47.125 --> 02:04:51.083
It was the first time
I ever saw a dead man. A friend.

02:04:51.166 --> 02:04:52.541
She was screaming.

02:04:52.625 --> 02:04:56.583
And I thought that no one
would ever beat me up again.

02:04:56.666 --> 02:04:58.250
That I'll be invincible.

02:04:58.333 --> 02:04:59.500
On our block

02:05:01.083 --> 02:05:03.666
you're either a nobody or a hooligan.

02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:06.125
And I'm not a nobody.

02:05:06.708 --> 02:05:08.708
Understand. I love you.

02:05:16.416 --> 02:05:18.708
-Fuck off!
-Shut the fuck up!

02:05:18.791 --> 02:05:22.958
Fuck off! Leave her! Fucking leave her!

02:05:23.541 --> 02:05:26.000
-Fuck, Messi, leave the girl!
-Mrówka?

02:05:26.083 --> 02:05:29.041
Are you fucking insane?
Attacking me with gear?

02:05:29.125 --> 02:05:31.416
Who was it? Fucking Olo?

02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:35.791
Kaszub's brother?
Do you still hold any power over Furioza?

02:05:35.875 --> 02:05:37.750
Last time!

02:05:38.291 --> 02:05:40.125
Let me talk with them!

02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:43.375
Do you fucking think
I have anything to lose?

02:05:43.458 --> 02:05:45.500
You're wildly mistaken!

02:05:51.458 --> 02:05:54.958
If we don't to this IRA deal,

02:05:55.583 --> 02:05:58.000
you'll be fucking gone,

02:05:58.958 --> 02:06:00.166
I'll be gone,

02:06:01.708 --> 02:06:03.333
and she'll be fucking gone.

02:06:04.541 --> 02:06:05.583
Let's go.

02:06:28.708 --> 02:06:30.166
I'm scared of you.

02:07:03.958 --> 02:07:05.583
-Hey!
-Come on, fucker!

02:07:06.166 --> 02:07:07.208
Let me go!

02:07:07.291 --> 02:07:10.333
-Come here!
-Relax! Let's talk!

02:07:10.416 --> 02:07:12.291
Let him talk. Relax.

02:07:12.375 --> 02:07:13.416
You done?

02:07:14.708 --> 02:07:17.041
Give the shirt back. You're not worthy.

02:07:17.833 --> 02:07:19.208
Guys, please.

02:07:19.291 --> 02:07:22.208
All right, we did
some fucking business together.

02:07:23.250 --> 02:07:25.500
I invested a ton of money.

02:07:25.583 --> 02:07:29.250
I need to finish this, or I'll get killed
by people you don't want to know.

02:07:29.333 --> 02:07:33.041
But that's on me. Guys, please!
Just a bit more time!

02:07:33.625 --> 02:07:35.208
Mrówka will be dead.

02:07:47.041 --> 02:07:49.000
It's not your time yet, Olo.

02:07:50.333 --> 02:07:53.125
-It's still not your decision.
-Set him up.

02:07:56.958 --> 02:07:58.375
I'll hold you to your word.

02:09:15.833 --> 02:09:17.333
Hold on.

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:18.833
Wait.

02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:33.750
What?

02:09:34.625 --> 02:09:37.791
-I didn't understand shit.
-Fuck, Golden.

02:09:38.416 --> 02:09:40.875
Fuck, look. He sent a pin.

02:09:43.541 --> 02:09:44.791
Fuck me.

02:09:46.333 --> 02:09:47.333
There.

02:09:51.916 --> 02:09:53.041
Fuck!

02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:06.208
Fucking pin. Look where it led me to.

02:10:07.458 --> 02:10:09.208
To the last centimeter.

02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:20.583
Mrówka!

02:10:21.458 --> 02:10:22.333
Yeah?

02:10:24.125 --> 02:10:25.500
Cool.

02:10:28.875 --> 02:10:30.166
Hold on. Fuck.

02:10:37.458 --> 02:10:38.541
Fuck!

02:10:41.625 --> 02:10:42.500
Fuck!

02:10:55.125 --> 02:10:57.375
What is it? What?

02:10:58.083 --> 02:10:59.250
I'll get wet.

02:11:00.875 --> 02:11:03.041
What? Okay!

02:11:03.666 --> 02:11:05.250
What did he say?

02:11:07.541 --> 02:11:08.375
Fuck off.

02:11:09.416 --> 02:11:11.875
Fuck, get in! There are cameras!

02:11:31.875 --> 02:11:34.875
Fuck, we can't drive this stuff ourselves.

02:11:35.708 --> 02:11:37.541
Golden!

02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:55.541
A courier's package also won't work.
If we mix it with herbs,

02:11:55.625 --> 02:11:58.875
the dogs at the border will sniff…
Fuck, I'm talking to you!

02:12:14.291 --> 02:12:16.916
We'll hide it in cane sugar.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.500
Fuck, the whole pallet?
And how will we extract it?

02:12:20.583 --> 02:12:22.208
Are you fucking insane?

02:12:25.958 --> 02:12:27.458
Fuck, they'll kill us.

02:12:56.583 --> 02:12:57.583
Fuck!

02:12:58.250 --> 02:12:59.375
Golden!

02:13:00.416 --> 02:13:02.083
Golden! Fuck…

02:13:03.041 --> 02:13:05.333
Fuck! Golden!

02:13:11.208 --> 02:13:12.250
Fuck!

02:13:13.291 --> 02:13:14.708
Fuck!

02:13:14.791 --> 02:13:17.416
Golden! I'll fucking kill you!

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.208
Fuck!

02:13:58.458 --> 02:13:59.291
Fuck!

02:14:24.208 --> 02:14:26.000
-What?
-Hello!

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.041
What do you want?

02:14:30.708 --> 02:14:32.750
Fuck off! Go!

02:14:33.708 --> 02:14:34.791
Damn Pole.

02:15:11.083 --> 02:15:14.291
I told you, "No, it's not him."

02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:26.000
I'm sorry!

02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:39.708
Yes?

02:15:39.791 --> 02:15:41.208
Fuck, Golden!

02:15:41.791 --> 02:15:42.625
Golden!

02:15:42.708 --> 02:15:45.875
Mrówka, I'm entering Gdańsk.

02:15:45.958 --> 02:15:47.583
Tricity.

02:15:47.666 --> 02:15:50.291
-I'll fucking kill you!
-Then I'll go to Sopot…

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:52.166
Not you. Fuck off!

02:15:52.916 --> 02:15:56.708
Turn left and you are there.

02:15:56.791 --> 02:15:58.000
Open the gate.

02:15:58.791 --> 02:16:01.166
-Fucking open it!
-Fuck, all right!

02:16:02.166 --> 02:16:03.333
Here he is!

02:16:03.416 --> 02:16:06.875
Blinker…

02:16:15.791 --> 02:16:18.541
Golden!

02:16:20.250 --> 02:16:21.458
-Fuck!
-Mrówka…

02:16:26.333 --> 02:16:27.916
Fuck!

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.083
Son of a bitch!

02:16:29.166 --> 02:16:31.083
-You beautiful bastard!
-Clear!

02:16:31.166 --> 02:16:34.458
Fuck! Not this side!

02:16:35.458 --> 02:16:37.500
Fuck, Golden! My man!

02:16:37.583 --> 02:16:39.958
-My baldy!
-Let me go.

02:16:40.041 --> 02:16:43.083
My man! Fuck, come here!

02:16:43.166 --> 02:16:45.625
Come. The smuggler of the millennium!

02:16:45.708 --> 02:16:48.333
-Come here.
-Let me go.

02:16:48.416 --> 02:16:50.250
-I'm all itchy.
-Fuck…

02:16:50.333 --> 02:16:52.708
What the fuck is happening?

02:16:52.791 --> 02:16:55.916
-I have lice. I have to shave.
-Fuck me…

02:16:58.583 --> 02:16:59.750
Get up.

02:17:04.083 --> 02:17:06.166
Get up!

02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:08.333
Get up!

02:17:24.375 --> 02:17:25.541
You won't sit down?

02:17:25.625 --> 02:17:27.833
You're in bed with Kaszub's killer.

02:17:30.625 --> 02:17:33.083
Stop it. I keep telling you…

02:17:33.166 --> 02:17:35.583
That bitch, Dzika! She was here!

02:17:35.666 --> 02:17:38.875
That bitch was here!
She's a pig, she lies!

02:17:38.958 --> 02:17:41.291
-Your father's watching!
-I'm sorry.

02:17:41.375 --> 02:17:43.916
Mommy, I'm sorry. Mom…

02:17:44.583 --> 02:17:47.791
Mom, you don't believe me?

02:17:48.291 --> 02:17:50.875
You believe her over me?

02:17:50.958 --> 02:17:52.708
Over me? That bitch!

02:18:01.083 --> 02:18:04.708
I'm sorry.

02:18:07.791 --> 02:18:08.625
Get out.

02:18:08.708 --> 02:18:12.583
-You believe her over me? She's a bitch.
-Out. And don't ever come back!

02:18:12.666 --> 02:18:13.958
Get out of here.

02:18:31.875 --> 02:18:32.958
Mommy…

02:18:33.916 --> 02:18:36.583
Mom, fuck. Open up!

02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:40.708
Open the door! Fuck!
Don't you get it, mom?

02:18:40.791 --> 02:18:44.000
Please. Mommy, I beg you, open the door!

02:18:44.541 --> 02:18:45.916
Mommy, I'm sorry.

02:18:46.416 --> 02:18:48.666
Mommy, fuck, open the door!

02:18:55.875 --> 02:18:57.500
-What's up?
-Hi.

02:18:58.833 --> 02:19:00.125
It's Scorpion.

02:19:01.250 --> 02:19:05.541
Fuck, I don't believe my eyes.

02:19:06.125 --> 02:19:07.083
Golden.

02:19:08.208 --> 02:19:11.416
Brother. From now on,
you can always count on us.

02:19:13.583 --> 02:19:16.250
Come, relax.

02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:23.166
And here's something extra
on account of future cooperation.

02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:25.000
Half a mil extra.

02:19:27.958 --> 02:19:31.083
-What are you loading in there?
-Cats and dogs.

02:19:31.166 --> 02:19:32.250
What?

02:19:33.041 --> 02:19:34.916
It's, kurwa, joke.

02:19:37.958 --> 02:19:40.333
Fuck, cats and dogs!

02:19:40.916 --> 02:19:41.791
Hold it.

02:19:45.166 --> 02:19:48.291
YOUR TAXI TRIP
CHINA TOWN RESTAURANT

02:20:06.458 --> 02:20:08.291
Fucking hell!

02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:18.875
Garbage truck! It was a garbage truck.

02:20:20.083 --> 02:20:22.666
There had to be one
on the site of Kaszub's murder.

02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:26.541
A fucking garbage truck.
I'm standing next to one.

02:20:26.625 --> 02:20:30.250
And what do I see?
A camera on its stinky ass!

02:20:30.333 --> 02:20:31.708
I'm coming back.

02:20:35.791 --> 02:20:37.916
Ten grand wouldn't fit. Are we good?

02:20:57.416 --> 02:20:59.541
Who's driving today?

02:21:04.125 --> 02:21:06.333
Mrówka killed my dad.

02:21:06.416 --> 02:21:08.541
-And you're dealing with him?
-Zuzia.

02:21:08.625 --> 02:21:10.250
Zizu, please.

02:21:11.666 --> 02:21:13.875
-Not you, Zuza. You know that…
-No!

02:21:13.958 --> 02:21:15.333
-Zuzka!
-Fuck off!

02:21:15.416 --> 02:21:16.750
Zuza…

02:21:17.458 --> 02:21:18.541
Never…

02:21:19.291 --> 02:21:21.000
Breaks!

02:21:21.083 --> 02:21:23.500
Zuza fights until the end!

02:21:54.458 --> 02:21:56.833
-What's up?
-When can you be here?

02:21:56.916 --> 02:21:59.625
-Half an hour. Why?
-I have the recording.

02:21:59.708 --> 02:22:01.500
You have something here.

02:22:15.291 --> 02:22:16.583
Come on!

02:22:51.791 --> 02:22:52.666
Fuck!

02:22:59.083 --> 02:23:00.250
Stop!

02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:04.916
Dzika!

02:23:09.708 --> 02:23:11.041
What's with you?

02:23:12.666 --> 02:23:14.958
You won't shoot me, huh?

02:23:22.125 --> 02:23:27.250
You bitch! Stay!

02:23:28.041 --> 02:23:29.375
Stay!

02:23:53.833 --> 02:23:54.958
Breathe in.

02:23:56.375 --> 02:23:57.708
And out. Breathe in.

02:23:58.291 --> 02:23:59.416
And out!

02:24:11.625 --> 02:24:13.000
You have two options.

02:24:13.083 --> 02:24:16.125
We post this video online,
and within a month,

02:24:16.208 --> 02:24:19.708
someone in prison helps you commit
an exceptionally successful suicide,

02:24:19.791 --> 02:24:23.250
or we bury the evidence, because…

02:24:25.291 --> 02:24:27.250
we won't destroy it, right?

02:24:27.916 --> 02:24:31.333
And little Golden hides in a mouse hole,

02:24:31.916 --> 02:24:35.458
where he'll continue to enjoy
the infamy of a bad hooligan.

02:24:35.541 --> 02:24:41.750
"Boo! I'm so evil! Furioza dada, Fur--"

02:24:42.708 --> 02:24:44.125
But he'll be ours.

02:24:46.125 --> 02:24:49.500
And if little Golden does anything shifty,

02:24:50.625 --> 02:24:53.625
a steamroller will run him over
and Golden will be no more.

02:24:57.791 --> 02:25:00.916
Good you have that ink. If they cut you,

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.875
your mom will at least
be able to identify your remains.

02:25:51.125 --> 02:25:52.166
Get out!

02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:34.375
You were our friend.

02:27:27.041 --> 02:27:30.958
Fuck, leave it! I know whose crib this is.
We'll get some pocket money for it.

02:27:33.791 --> 02:27:36.416
Fucking faster! Ouch!

02:28:02.958 --> 02:28:05.000
There are no more true hooligans.

02:28:08.458 --> 02:28:12.041
Fuck. There's only money.

02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:32.083
Relax.

02:28:34.625 --> 02:28:37.541
They're waiting for us at the border.

02:28:37.625 --> 02:28:40.333
Dima paid them. It will be straight.

02:28:45.708 --> 02:28:49.708
We have a cool place in Odessa.

02:28:49.791 --> 02:28:53.041
You'll get some rest.
And we'll get you citizenship.

02:28:53.125 --> 02:28:56.458
You want to be Ukrainian? Or American?

02:28:58.666 --> 02:29:00.333
Fuck, turn back!

02:29:00.416 --> 02:29:02.958
With your money,
you can be whoever you want.

02:29:05.458 --> 02:29:07.083
Damn!

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.875
I said, turn the fuck back!

02:29:20.583 --> 02:29:22.083
Who can understand you?

02:29:27.875 --> 02:29:29.333
-Olo.
-What's up?

02:29:29.416 --> 02:29:30.791
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.

02:29:32.333 --> 02:29:34.083
Golden said to give this to you.

02:29:35.875 --> 02:29:37.333
All right, thanks.

02:29:45.416 --> 02:29:46.916
FURIOZA

02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:30.083
FOR ZUZIA

02:30:30.166 --> 02:30:31.125
ZUZA NEVER BREAKS

02:31:01.625 --> 02:31:02.958
You were right about the sea.

02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:07.083
You can't buy it.

02:32:02.375 --> 02:32:03.500
Golden!

02:32:03.583 --> 02:32:06.791
Golden!

02:32:07.833 --> 02:32:08.750
Golden!

02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:11.291
Golden!

02:32:11.375 --> 02:32:13.416
High five!

02:32:13.500 --> 02:32:15.666
Give me the ball!

02:32:17.583 --> 02:32:18.583
Pass it!

02:32:19.958 --> 02:32:21.916
He runs! Yes!

02:32:22.916 --> 02:32:23.916
On the goal, people!

02:32:24.666 --> 02:32:25.583
Go on!

02:32:31.625 --> 02:32:35.708
Furioza!

02:32:35.791 --> 02:32:38.833
Furioza!

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.208
-Krzywy.
-What's up?

02:33:01.875 --> 02:33:03.750
Kaszub would want…

02:33:05.041 --> 02:33:07.041
Olo to take over Furioza.

02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:09.083
What the fuck?

02:33:10.291 --> 02:33:11.833
It's time.

02:33:19.291 --> 02:33:23.083
Unsecured proof.
Only three people have access.

02:33:36.708 --> 02:33:37.958
Fuck.

02:33:43.875 --> 02:33:45.708
-What?
-Marek!

02:34:04.083 --> 02:34:04.958
What's up?

02:34:05.041 --> 02:34:07.375
The footage was posted on Furioza's group.

02:34:07.458 --> 02:34:09.041
"All will hear about this."

02:34:09.125 --> 02:34:10.958
God fucking dammit.

02:34:49.625 --> 02:34:52.666
Leave him. He's mine!

02:34:53.375 --> 02:34:55.000
I'm glad you're here.

02:34:55.083 --> 02:34:58.500
I didn't know what to do with myself.

02:35:22.458 --> 02:35:24.583
Wait. Give him a second.

02:35:24.666 --> 02:35:26.375
Fucking get him!

02:35:28.833 --> 02:35:29.958
-Yeah!
-Good!

02:35:32.625 --> 02:35:34.125
Fucking get him!

02:35:34.208 --> 02:35:36.000
-Come on!
-Punch him!

02:35:41.041 --> 02:35:43.375
-End him!
-Like that!

02:35:44.708 --> 02:35:45.791
Come on!

02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:57.583
But it was great on the highway, huh?

02:35:58.166 --> 02:35:59.333
Finish him!

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:20.833
Right.

02:36:24.583 --> 02:36:25.541
Right.

02:36:34.166 --> 02:36:35.875
Fuck. Go get him!

02:36:40.416 --> 02:36:41.666
-Come on!
-No!

02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:43.291
Leave me alone! Let me go!

02:36:43.375 --> 02:36:45.541
That's enough! Leave him be.

02:36:45.625 --> 02:36:47.458
-Get him out!
-Come on.

02:36:47.541 --> 02:36:50.583
-No, I'm here with you.
-Get lost, you hear me?

02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:24.791
INSIDE FURIOZA
