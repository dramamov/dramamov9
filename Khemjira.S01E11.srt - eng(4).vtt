00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.920
Khem!

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm sorry, Jet,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.640
but I can't bear losing anyone again.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.800
We're coming with you, then.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.880
Khem's birthday is in seven days.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.120
If he makes it until then,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.280
the curse will be lifted.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.520
Are you sure you can handle this

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.920
without your master?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080
He's already lost so much for me.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.880
- Khemjira must survive!
- Khemjira must survive!

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120
Khem,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.440
don't give up yet.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.459
Let go!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.450
Let go of me!

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.440
Hey!

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.479
You finally showed up, Mr. Fancy-pants.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.360
Thought you'd let your buddy
get his ass kicked,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.210
huh?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.660
Let my bro go.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.760
If you wanna blame someone, blame me.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.329
You both are pieces of shit.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.970
If you hadn't poked your nose
into our turf,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.050
the girls wouldn't have dumped me.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.660
And even my girl,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.840
Khaopad, dumped me!

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.200
With that ugly mug of yours,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.860
whether it's Khaopad,
Khaosuay, or Khaoniew,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.500
no girl's gonna pick you, dude.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800
You've got a smart mouth, huh?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.280
Hey!

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.220
My bro!

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.530
Kachen, my buddy,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.620
run!

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.880
What do you want?

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.900
I already broke up with her.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.160
If you want her,
go ask her out yourself.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.700
Fuck that.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.270
Bring that pretty mug over here

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.080
so we can beat it up.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.800
You up for it?

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.030
Fine.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.100
If I win,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.860
let my buddy go.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.130
No!

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.640
My buddy,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.400
don't do that!

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.220
Don't stop me, Paran.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.200
Just think of it

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.560
as me paying for the sin

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.780
of being born this hot.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.860
If you're ready to die, bring it on!

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.329
Hey, guys.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.560
Kachen!

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.079
My buddy... No!

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.240
Kachen,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.810
run!

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.480
No!

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.900
Run.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.120
Kachen,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.360
no!

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.680
Gosh,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.300
cut the boasting, Kachen.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.500
The truth is a hundred times smaller.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.270
What took you so long?

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.820
I was...

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.110
So you handled all of them?

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.230
Yeah.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.780
Pay the compensation to them for me.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.280
I think...

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.980
you got it all wrong, Jane.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.000
Anyway, guys,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.560
since then, Paran and I

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.520
have become best buddies,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.160
like ride-or-die kind of friends.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.640
Right, bro?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.680
So,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.120
you were a thug, Master?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.620
I only defended myself.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.590
I've let go of that life.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.590
Growing up means getting wiser,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.600
not just getting older.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.310
Come on, man.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.990
Master just said
you need to get wiser, too.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.380
Jet,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.170
you know very well...

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.780
my age isn't the only thing
that's bigger.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.660
You forgot,

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.460
huh?

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.740
Shall we dig up some old memories,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:30.830
huh?

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.660
You down?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.840
Hey!

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.920
Quit it.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.290
Can you stop messing with my brother?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.120
Enough.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.180
I called Kachen here today

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.260
because we need him.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.120
Right, Jane.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.600
Are you still putting spells
on your tukata sia kaban?

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.980
Well,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.720
I do perform some spells,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.240
but not seriously...

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.130
I treat them as art toys.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.520
No need to lie.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.890
I don't mind it.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.430
We really need them this time.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.800
Ramphueng won't hear anything

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.080
we say in this room.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.320
I'll go over the whole plan just once.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.030
These materials are consecrated.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.120
Tell me if you need help.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.680
Get it done as quickly as you can.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.700
I'm made to handle urgent tasks, Master.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I'll make it in time.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.900
What are you doing, Khem?

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.440
You seem dedicated.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.940
Some keepsakes.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.940
At first, I planned to...

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.020
send a letter to everyone

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.380
so that if I were gone,

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.640
they'd have something to remember me by.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.860
But now,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.440
I'll use this

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.520
to remember those who've helped me.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.110
♫Just one glance, and I could feel♫

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.490
♫A vow long hidden, suddenly revealed,♫

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.870
♫Leading our souls in a destined appeal♫

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.100
♫To meet once more with a bond to seal♫

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.760
You don't need to
bear all of this alone anymore.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.840
You need to trust everyone, Khem.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.780
♫It's more than love at first sight,♫

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.990
♫But a bond through every life♫

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.470
♫Our destinies cross again in this life♫

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.540
♫You'll be my last, my eternal light,♫

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.870
♫From now until the end of time♫

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.440

♫These words will still be true,♫

♫I love you♫

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.800
Whoa, bro.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.260
That was dope.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.760
What do you think, Charn?

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.520
Was that dope?

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.500
Yes,

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.400
very...

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.120
Hey.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.840
Are you okay?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.690
I think that was too slow.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.760
To run from that Ramphueng,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.120
we need to be faster.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.280
I can do it for you if you can't.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.780
Master said

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.360
this task needs Charn's instincts.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.840
Don't worry.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.600
One more round with him
and you'll get used to it.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.800
You really trust him, don't you?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.420
If my instincts weren't strong,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.220
you'd have let him handle it.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.830
You sure he's got this?

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.240
No matter what, I'm going with him.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.150
Whoa,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.800
I've never seen you
trust someone this much.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.170
Don't bother him too much.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.400
Just focus on teaching him.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.110
What, Jane?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.440
Yeah.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.480
We're fine.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.400
How long have you known Jet, Charn?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.400
We met at the volunteer camp

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.940
a month ago.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.880
Only a month?

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.750
I've known him since he was 16.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.540
Oh, yeah?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.420
He never mentioned you.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.920
Maybe he's been busy.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.520
We haven't met
since he went to university.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.440
Oh, okay.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.880
If you're really close,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.720
you'd probably make time to meet.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.250
We're really close.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.859
We've been through a lot together,
you know.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.480
How close...

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.840
are you two, though?

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.760
What do you mean?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.800
Well,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.960
I got close to him...

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.040
'cause I was his first.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.200
Well,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.750
I've never done it with anyone before.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240
So...

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.560
I'm your first?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.720
Obviously.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.320
You're shocked, huh?

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.750
He didn't tell you, did he?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.450
If he didn't mention it,

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.800
I probably don't need to know.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960
Suit yourself.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.090
But if you can outpace me today,

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.300
I'll tell you myself.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.600
Deal?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.880
Get in the car.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.120
No need to rush.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.280
We have all afternoon.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.020
Holy shit!

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.880
That's even faster.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.040
Shit,

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.540
that was you?

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.240
Charn,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.600
that was fire!

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.450
Hey, bro.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.410
You alright?

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.160
Was that your revenge?

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.360
No,

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.280
I was just...

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.680
What?

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.200
I was hoping you'd have a plan.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.990
Still, I must praise you.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.250
In so little time,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.620
you've sealed the trace of his spirit
so completely.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.120
A little retaliation is welcome.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.600
Don't fail me.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.400
So that I can enjoy myself...

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.240
Before every last one of you

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.360
gets wiped out tonight.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.600
I told you
to use a different car, didn't I?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.880
This won't seat all of us.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.120
You said you needed it
to run away from that ghost.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.080
This is the cheapest one.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.920
Is this...

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.840
the cheapest one?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.360
That's right, Khem.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.840
But it's gonna be pretty tight.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.760
Be careful.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.760
Don't ever get hurt,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.680
okay?

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.840
I know.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.760
Don't worry.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.840
I'm hard to kill, you know.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.780
Ouch!

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.650
Hard to kill, huh?

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.680
Come on, Jane.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.320
Can't you let me be cool for a sec?

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200
Please protect him.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.960
He's my only brother.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.280
You don't need to worry.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.520
I won't let anything happen to him.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.080
Don't push yourself too hard, either.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720
Are you ready?

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.840
Yes.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.640
Come with me.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.800
You sure
you don't wanna know it anymore?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.280
Yes.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.720
Whatever his past was,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.640
it doesn't matter to me.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.360
The only one I care to be with

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.440
is who he is now.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.240
Whoa,

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.400
you've won my heart, man.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Hey, Kachen.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600
The time has come.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.560
May you all be safe.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.200
That's not him.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.640
Follow them.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.080
They're here.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.040
Oh, shit!

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.960
Ramphueng's been growing her power
for over 400 years.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.560
The closer we get to Khem's birthday,

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.080
the stronger she becomes.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.960
Even I can't say for certain
that I can stop her.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.440
But there's one thing on our side,

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.440
and that is time.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.200
We'll stall her

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.960
and lure her into wasting her strength.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.000
The curse that binds her to Khem

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.080
lets her sense Khem's soul
no matter where she is.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.160
I'll enchant Khem's belongings

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.840
and have you all carry them.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.000
It should confuse her for a while.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.400
But she won't be fooled for long.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.640
When she knows, Jane's tukata sia kaban

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.760
will radiate
the strongest trace of Khem's soul.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.640
Someone will have to stand in
as the false Khem

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.560
and lure her into this trap.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880
Calm down.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.120
Let your instincts guide you.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.960
I'm right here with you.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.720
You're lucky you can't see ghosts.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.480
I don't think so.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.080
Either way,
that car's trying to run us over.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.040
Shit...

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.280
Hold tight, Jet.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.840
They're still here.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.080
Charn, stop!

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.240
What's going on?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.640
Why don't they...

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.520
Shit...

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.720
She's here, isn't she?

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.800
Hold on.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.440
I need a moment.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.480
If you think
those sacred rice grains will save you,

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.320
I'm warning you.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:44.199
They'll only make your death
even more painful.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.200
So...

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.120
that's all that shaman
could come up with?

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.600
I expected he'd have something better.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.600
Don't you dare insult my master,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.880
you witch!

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.040
Witch?

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.560
I am no witch.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.440
That's not what I meant.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.920
It was a curse.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.240
Shit!

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.280
What happened?

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320
What did she do?

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.800
I don't know.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.440
That shaman came to you just a day ago,

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.640
but your soul's already grown stronger.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.120
Oh,

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.500
so you're trying to control my mind?

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.520
Not a chance.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.720
You're not the only one whose mind
I would control.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.200
Jet!

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.240
Jet?

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.000
How dare you deceive me?

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.000
Jet!

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:10.880
Jet!

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.720
Jet!

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.240
Charn...

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.120
Jet...

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.000
Jet!

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:18.920
Jet...

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.960
Charn...

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.920
Jet!

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.610
Jet...

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:23.320
Charn...

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.280
Jet!

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.800
Charn...

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.800
Jet...

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.640
Jet...

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.360
Jet...

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.680
Ramphueng,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.320
I'm begging you.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.920
Please let us go.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.160
We're not part of this.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.160
Then why do you meddle in what's mine?!

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.920
Jet!

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.840
Jet...

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.400
Jet!

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.680
Jet!

00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.080
Jet...

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.620
Tell me

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.600
where Khem is.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.920
Answer me,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.240
and I shall spare you.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.960
Jet!

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.280
The dorm!

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.240
Kachen and I were just decoys.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.880
Master's there with Khem,
waiting for midnight to pass.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.700
Khemjira...

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:53.750
Jet!

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.800
Jet, wake up.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.840
Jet...

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.200
Wake up and talk to me.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:03.920
You said...

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.040
we'd make it out together, remember?

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.320
Jet,

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.800
please wake up.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.140
Please...

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.440
Jet...

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.460
Khemjira...

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.600
Together.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.020
Khemjira...

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.720
You are exceedingly bold to deceive me.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.470
If you keep fooling around with me,

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.470
you'll miss your chance
to get to your target.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.310
All set.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.470
I've had my butler
get the private jet ready.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:00.790
We'll take off
as soon as we reach the airport.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:04.910
I even told you to get a different car,

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.460
yet you brought another two-seater.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:10.630
Come on,

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.910
this is just perfect.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.070
Cozy, you know?

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.190
Are you tired?

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.070
I'm not.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:32.710
I'm worried that I'm too heavy.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.190
Not at all.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:43.030
Keep your eyes on the road.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:45.770
Yeah, yeah.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.550
Luang Por Derm's yantra

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.190
perfectly hides all traces of your soul,

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.190
so Ramphueng's not after us.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:16.590
Don't worry.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.630
From here to the destination,

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:22.830
you'll be completely safe.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.150
That means she's definitely after Jet.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.110
He may not seem serious,

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.410
but when he needs to be,

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.910
he's actually pretty strong.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.550
I know he's strong,

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.150
but I'm afraid
he might push himself too hard.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.110
Just remember,

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.190
he is not facing this alone.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:33.390
Da?

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:34.750
Jin...

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:46.830
Da,

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:48.590
how did you get here?

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.270
Your friend snuck me in.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:55.030
I don't have much time

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.830
before your mom comes.

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.110
Da,

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.190
I'm sorry.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:03.350
I'm really sorry.

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:06.990
Why would you be?

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:09.790
You've done nothing wrong.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:14.270
I thought

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.150
my mom would understand

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:18.710
and let me come with you.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:24.110
It's okay, Jin.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.150
It's totally okay.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.430
I'm leaving today.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.190
I'm really sorry,

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.790
but I can't bear
seeing you marry someone else.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:47.670
I'm coming with you, then.

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:49.830
Right now, just us two.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.230
What about your wedding

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.350
and your parents?

00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:59.190
You can't do that, Jin.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.190
You look so gorgeous

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:13.470
in your wedding dress.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.550
I'm sorry

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.550
I can't be by your side today.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:46.470
Da,

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:50.110
do you think

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:53.990
there's a world

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:59.110
where people of the same gender
can get married?

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.310
You're dreaming again.

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.110
That kind of world doesn't exist.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.310
But even if we can't get married,

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:15.150
you'll always be the one I love

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.150
in this life

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.990
or any other.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:22.470
Da,

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.030
but I believe

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.110
such a world exists.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.110
I don't know where,

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.350
but someday,

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.870
we'll meet again

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.190
in a world where we can get married

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:44.190
and...

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:46.910
be together forever.

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:49.950
Because you're the only one

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.750
my heart belongs to

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:56.590
in this life

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.230
and every life to come.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.910
♫No more will I let your hand go,♫

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.710

25, 26, 27,

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.200
28, 29, 30...

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:07.910
No, Charn.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.630
Come on, wake up.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.030
No, Charn.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.630
You need to be with me in this life!

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.150
Wake up.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:28.590
Don't you see...

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.670
a world where we could be together?

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.690
Wake up, Charn.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.230
Charn...

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:02.510
Charn...

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:03.630
Charn!

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:04.550
Jet...

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.750
Forgive me for making you worry.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:20.990
In this life,

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:24.230
let's finish the story we once began.

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.290
♫No more will I let your hand go,♫

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:36.040
♫Through dream or dawn,
our bond will grow♫

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.340
♫With our two souls,♫

♫While I hold your hand tight

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:23.230
If you keep fooling around with me,

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.410
you'll miss your chance
to get to your target.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.070
Who do you think you're up against?

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:41.950
You asked for this yourself.

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:04.220
You're not here.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:10.780
Where are you?

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:16.740
Come, Ramphueng.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.270
Let's end this.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:27.830
Soon you will see what I can do!

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.350
I'll be at the ordination hall.

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:45.950
At midnight,
I'll strike the gong to let you know.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:49.630
Thanks a lot.

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:52.990
I hope you stay safe, Khem.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.940
I'll be waiting
to wish you a happy birthday.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.790
Thank you, Kachen.

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:17.410
If you are to use it, think carefully,

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:19.590
for it carries

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:22.310
the power of the sacred weapon,

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:25.070
belonging to the guardian
of the Underworld treasures.

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:27.870
The human body you inhabit

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.510
is not meant to endure such might.

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:34.230
Is that the weapon
Lord of the Mountains gave you?

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:37.550
Yeah.

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:40.350
Just in case.

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:45.830
I hope I won't need it.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.390
She is almost here.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:17.990
Keep yourself inside the sacred ring
with Monk Kasem.

00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:21.950
No matter what happens,

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.270
do not leave the ring.

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:30.870
In a few hours,

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:35.150
we'll celebrate your birthday together.

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:39.190
Here I am.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:32.650
A monk?

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.190
I see.

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:41.190
Venerable,

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:44.910
this is no concern of yours.

01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:50.390
Leave now before my patience withers.

01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:24.910
You damn shaman...

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.470
You never fail to cause me trouble.

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:31.190
You've lost.

01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:35.630
Now go atone for what you've done.

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:39.070
What makes you think

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:41.270
I'd ever lose to you?

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:48.510
You should've realized it
when you came here alone.

01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:55.950
I've freed every spirit in this place.

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:02.910
There are no wandering souls left
for you to command.

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.670
Even if you call upon those from afar,

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.510
they won't reach you in time.

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:13.510
Then...

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.270
face me alone.

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:31.010
Do you think your invisibility spell

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:32.990
can save you?

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:35.630
Who knows?

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.790
But the clock is ticking.

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:43.350
Show yourself.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.990
I don't have time for your nonsense.

01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:56.190
A relentless spirit like you

01:03:57.230 --> 01:04:00.150
cannot stand against
Phraya Ananta Nagaraja's might.

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:04.390
I bet Phraya Ananta Nagaraja...

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:07.950
can't even keep you breathing, can he?

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.340
Master!

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:51.910
I granted you a chance,

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:54.910
but since you insist on opposing me,

01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:56.750
then die.

01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:49.910
It's past midnight.

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:53.390
Khem's 21 now.

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:55.470
Let him go.

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:59.190
And why should I do that?

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:05.230
If you break the vow you swore,

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.910
your soul will fade away.

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:12.470
The vow I swore?

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:15.990
Ramphueng,

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:20.310
I understand
losing your son must've hurt deeply,

01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:26.750
but I have nothing to do with it.

01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:30.790
Let's finally set each other free.

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:34.630
No.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:37.430
This can't be the end.

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:43.070
It's over.

01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:46.990
Go and face your karma.

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:06.830
They're finally here.

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:44.990
You may not know

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.030
that a place not far from here

01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:51.430
was once a battlefield,

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:56.230
filled with spirits
I could bind to serve me.

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.550
And you probably didn't know

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.630
when I said

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:09.750
Khem must die at 21,

01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:17.229
I never said it had to be at midnight.

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:22.510
He was born at six in the morning.

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:34.670
Peem!

01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:05.710
I can sense that Khem's still alive,

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.149
but that doesn't mean he's safe.

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:09.950
Please stop.

01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:13.270
My life is all you want, right?

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.390
Khem...

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:15.990
Go back!

01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:18.229
In my past life,

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.390
I let someone die right before my eyes.

01:09:23.069 --> 01:09:25.790
You will know the pain I've felt.

01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:27.390
Goodbye.

01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:35.729
♫It's more than love at first sight,♫

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:37.870
♫But a bond through every life♫

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:41.490
