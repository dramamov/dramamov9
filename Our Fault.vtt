OUR
FAULT

01:00.520 --> 01:03.360
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY
MERCEDES RON

01:16.440 --> 01:17.320
Yes, beautiful.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.840
FORBES
THE LEISTER HEIR CONQUERS LONDON

01:35.560 --> 01:40.280
"IT'S BEEN A TOUGH FOUR YEARS."

01:41.600 --> 01:42.920
CHOCOLATE WITH MILK
AND ALMONDS

01:44.920 --> 01:47.080
No need to wrap it.
I'm going to eat it now.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.200
Excuse me.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.840
Sorry! I'm sorry. Shit.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.400
Don't worry, it's not noticeable.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.080
I'm wearing coffee-colored pants.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.680
I always wear them when I fly.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.480
Me, a chocolate-colored skirt.

02:19.720 --> 02:20.840
Simón.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.160
Noah.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.120
Can I take you somewhere?
We can share a cab.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.800
I'm being picked up. Thank you.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.000
I enjoyed chatting with you.

02:48.880 --> 02:49.720
Likewise.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.160
Hey. I'm going to be here for a week.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.760
If you give me your number,
perhaps one day...

02:57.800 --> 02:59.120
I understand. As you wish.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.520
Hey. But if we meet again,
you owe me a coffee.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.600
Deal.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.920
Noah! Noah!

03:24.760 --> 03:25.680
You're here!

03:25.760 --> 03:26.600
I'm here!

03:27.160 --> 03:28.960
-I'm getting married!
-Yes!

03:29.040 --> 03:31.079
Let's go.
I can't wait to show you everything.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.720
You bridesmaids
have your dress fitting this afternoon.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.040
Then the private party,
and tomorrow, the rehearsals.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.000
-I'm so anxious.
-Yeah.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.880
These are for the bridesmaids.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.920
-It's beautiful! I love it.
-So cute!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And these masks...

03:50.079 --> 03:52.160
They're adhesive pushups.
They go like this.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.640
Anything for the ass?

03:53.720 --> 03:55.520
No one can lift that ass anymore!

03:56.000 --> 03:57.280
This is your dress, Noah.

03:57.360 --> 04:01.200
This one? But...
This isn't a bridesmaid's dress, is it?

04:01.280 --> 04:04.280
Those flowers don't go there.
They go in the kitchen.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.640
Jenna. Jenna, can you explain
what's going on?

04:07.120 --> 04:08.880
-You didn't match with my cousins.
-Sure.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.080
The cheese corner under that tree.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.040
-God, what a mess.
-Am I going to be the maid of honor?

04:15.120 --> 04:17.480
Amy! Leave the dresses
and come sort things out.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.519
-Don't do this to me, please.
-Who ordered blue tablecloths?

04:21.040 --> 04:22.360
Who's going to be the best man?

04:22.440 --> 04:24.280
Please understand.
You're our best friends.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.760
No. Don't do this to me
at your wedding, please.

04:26.840 --> 04:31.320
It's been a while. You've moved on.
The snifters go there.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.760
You're an asshole.
This isn't right, you know?

04:34.840 --> 04:37.240
Don't worry.
Everything is going to be great.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.000
You know I'm an expert
in organizing parties.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.000
Come on, let's go.

05:09.920 --> 05:14.400
TO THE LIGHTHOUSE
VIRGINIA WOOLF

05:26.320 --> 05:28.880
IBICENCÁN PARTY
NOAH

05:31.400 --> 05:32.920
You're unbelievable, Jenna.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.560
Not sure if he's my cousin or my uncle,
but he's from my family in Miami.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.640
-Bye.
-Hi.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.600
Those hippies lived so well in Ibiza.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.760
You're the one living well, asshole, huh?

07:59.320 --> 08:01.760
I'm so happy for you, brother.
That's so great.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.680
Lion...

08:04.760 --> 08:07.600
Jenna is looking for you
to take some pictures with her cousins.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.680
They put me in a WhatsApp group.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.120
"The pushups."

08:28.000 --> 08:29.240
You didn't call me back.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.280
What I asked you for was not for me.
It was for a friend.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.200
You know what I mean.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.400
You're Lion's brother.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.080
I already was back then.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.520
Right.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.320
There, like that.
You look divine. Smile, everyone.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.720
How beautiful!

09:05.480 --> 09:07.360
Very cute. Smile, everyone!

09:07.440 --> 09:09.280
We're like Jenna and her cousins.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.280
We only see each other
at weddings and funerals these days.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.520
-The restaurant takes up my weekends.
-Wonderful.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.480
-Will!
-Me too? Yes?

09:19.560 --> 09:20.400
Rafaella.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.840
-Come on!
-Can you take a picture of us?

09:22.920 --> 09:24.920
Of course. Here you go. Let's see.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.520
What a privilege!

09:29.800 --> 09:30.640
Ready!

10:01.880 --> 10:03.400
JENNA LOVES LION

10:04.600 --> 10:05.800
We're all here.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.240
The rehearsal will be at the resort.
It's ten kilometers away.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.240
We sent a message with the location.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.000
Exactly. Lion, you're taking
your mother and Jenna's father.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.880
-Nick, did you bring the child seat?
-I got it at the airport.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.960
Terrific. Jeremy, you're going with him.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.480
So? Ready to be my copilot?

10:25.760 --> 10:27.200
What about me? Here?

10:27.280 --> 10:28.320
No, go with Nick.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.680
With Nick? No. No, please--

10:32.440 --> 10:35.120
Long live the bride and groom! Long live!

12:03.000 --> 12:04.200
It smells really strong.

12:06.680 --> 12:07.760
It's my aftershave.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.880
How was it with Nick and Noah?

13:27.960 --> 13:29.920
Fine. It's like going with Mom and Dad.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.760
We move forward a little bit more.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.280
That's it. Perfect. Very good.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.760
Now, the honor attendants.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.560
Come on, take his arm.

13:50.480 --> 13:54.920
On my signal, we all advance down
the aisle starting on the right foot.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.880
Jeremy, can you take your hands
out of your pockets?

13:57.960 --> 13:59.360
Don't we have the ring cushion?

13:59.440 --> 14:01.800
Then bring him something to practice with.

14:09.320 --> 14:13.120
Stay close together. All right. Ready?

14:27.640 --> 14:30.600
Father, forgive me,
but you're in the wrong place.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.200
I'm sorry, son.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.400
I didn't even know blue roses existed.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.200
You little devil! This is for grown-ups!

14:55.280 --> 14:56.800
But it tastes like candy!

14:57.840 --> 14:59.080
Dinner, then straight to bed!

15:05.400 --> 15:07.160
-Hey, Luca.
-Hey.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.280
I saw you before, but you disappeared.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.000
I haven't seen you since you got out.
How's the garage?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.440
Very well, brother.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.520
I'm sorry about your grandfather.
At least he didn't suffer.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.360
I appreciate it.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.760
You got a tattoo?

15:29.280 --> 15:30.120
Yes.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.320
You're mine

15:33.800 --> 15:37.960
Don't worry, I've also committed
the same idiocy a bunch of times. Look.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.760
Wow. Looks like the jackpot went to Lola.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.840
She's my mother. My one true love.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.600
You look handsome.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.960
Dearly beloved--

16:34.400 --> 16:38.080
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

16:38.160 --> 16:42.120
to join in holy matrimony
this man and this woman.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.640
Welcome to all of you,
whether you are family or friends.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.480
I take you as my wife, Jenna...

16:57.640 --> 16:59.080
and promise to be faithful

17:00.440 --> 17:04.040
in health, in sickness,

17:05.440 --> 17:09.000
for richer and for poorer.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.960
And so, to love and respect you

17:14.520 --> 17:19.560
all the days of my life,
until death or life do us part.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.560
Therefore, I declare you--

17:28.200 --> 17:29.400
Husband and wife.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.280
I love you.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.520
Where are you going on your honeymoon?

18:05.440 --> 18:06.840
Do you know the Seychelles?

18:07.600 --> 18:08.840
No, I've never been.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.080
I have a sexual fantasy that I want to...

18:14.240 --> 18:17.320
You've chosen the destination
to satisfy a sexual fantasy?

18:19.080 --> 18:20.520
To do it under a waterfall.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.000
What?

18:23.080 --> 18:26.400
Imagine it. An idyllic waterfall,

18:26.480 --> 18:29.080
the stream of water
falling over our bodies...

18:29.160 --> 18:30.240
Hey!

18:30.320 --> 18:32.000
Be careful, she's my daughter.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.560
Mr. Tavish...

18:35.360 --> 18:36.560
That's impossible, man.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.000
Why?

18:38.560 --> 18:40.200
Any idea how hard the water falls?

18:40.280 --> 18:41.480
I've already told him.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.240
But since he saw it in that ad,
no way to get it out of his mind.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.160
Well, fuck, let me dream, right?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.520
It's my honeymoon.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.200
Let the bride and groom dance!

18:50.280 --> 18:51.480
Come on, cousin!

19:07.880 --> 19:13.040
Just another day
Planning to get you back

19:14.320 --> 19:18.840
The house is like hell
The memories are burning

19:18.920 --> 19:22.080
And I like a masochist
I left everything as it was

19:22.160 --> 19:24.760
But now that you're not here

19:26.480 --> 19:29.320
I realized what I lost

19:30.800 --> 19:35.160
It may not be too late
To see you and tell you

19:35.240 --> 19:38.440
That I'm still crazy about your love

19:38.520 --> 19:43.040
I want to tell you that I'm sorry
That I miss you

19:43.120 --> 19:46.640
That all that's happened, baby
I regret it

19:46.720 --> 19:50.000
I still love you

19:50.720 --> 19:54.600
Don't think
That I've given you up for lost

19:54.680 --> 19:59.200
I want to tell you that I'm sorry
That I miss you

19:59.280 --> 20:03.240
That all that's happened, baby
I regret it

20:03.320 --> 20:06.880
I still love you

20:06.960 --> 20:11.960
Don't think
That I've given you up for lost

20:12.040 --> 20:17.320
I wish I could reset my mind
So it doesn't think of you

20:17.400 --> 20:20.080
But what do you want me
To do about it, baby?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.880
I'm not gonna lie to you

20:21.960 --> 20:24.480
It's just that
I'm drowning every second...

20:26.080 --> 20:27.840
She must be having a terrible time.

20:29.880 --> 20:30.720
Stop it.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.640
How are you?

20:37.920 --> 20:39.280
Very happy for you guys.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.520
Sorry, my emotions are getting mixed up.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.600
Come on. Now, the honor attendants.

20:50.160 --> 20:55.200
I want to tell you that I'm sorry
That I miss you

20:55.280 --> 21:00.160
That all that's happened, baby
I regret it

21:00.240 --> 21:04.040
I still love you

21:04.120 --> 21:09.720
Don't think that
I've given you up for lost...

21:11.600 --> 21:14.440
Operation Honor Attendants
is proving to be pathetic.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.920
I'll say.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.440
They're more concerned about us
than about their own wedding.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.360
It's not going to work.

22:38.680 --> 22:39.520
Hi.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.800
I found what you wrote in the cemetery.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.480
"I will always be
your light in the darkness."

23:08.080 --> 23:10.400
The rain will have washed it away by now.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.920
No. Today, I saw
that light is still there.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.320
I've seen it in your eyes.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.920
Do you know what I see when I close them?

23:26.360 --> 23:27.320
I see you with him.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.040
If you leave, turn off the light.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.440
Don't you sleep with the light on?

23:46.720 --> 23:48.360
We can overcome everything.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.480
Here's your degree, Ms. Graduate.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.240
Thank you very much, María.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.200
We're going to miss you.

24:51.000 --> 24:51.840
Me too.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.760
Goodbye.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.240
WANTED FOR HIRE
DELIVERY PERSON WITH OWN VEHICLE

25:12.200 --> 25:14.840
You're looking for
an employee with a car, right?

25:24.280 --> 25:25.280
I'm sorry.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.120
Hey! Are you okay?

25:45.320 --> 25:48.200
I switched shifts with Edu.
I'll leave you the schedule, okay?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.600
ALAMEDA
GENERAL HOSPITAL

25:49.680 --> 25:51.040
-How are you, Alicia?
-Fine.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.080
Good morning, Michael. Sit down.

26:00.440 --> 26:01.280
Well...

26:01.360 --> 26:04.240
When the boss calls you,
there's always a reason.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.600
The bike my friend sold you, is it okay?

26:07.680 --> 26:10.160
Yes. Amazing. Thank you.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.040
How long have you been in mental health?

26:14.360 --> 26:15.360
A year.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.760
I've been reviewing your résumé,

26:18.840 --> 26:22.120
and you didn't include
that you had worked at the university.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.080
It was as a counselor.
I didn't think it was relevant.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.560
Right. You got fired
for sleeping with a student, didn't you?

26:33.080 --> 26:36.000
Ramón, you haven't had
a single problem with me.

26:36.080 --> 26:37.640
Nor do we want to.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.880
That's why you'll understand
we are obliged

26:39.960 --> 26:42.240
to initiate the appropriate protocol
for these cases.

26:42.320 --> 26:45.160
-There's nothing to investigate.
-This is not public healthcare.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.320
We can't take the chance
that something like this

26:47.400 --> 26:49.640
happens again with one of our clients.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.760
Who gave you this information?

26:53.800 --> 26:57.160
We'll keep you posted
on the progress of the case.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.280
Thank you very much.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.760
My first job was in insurance.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.760
I used to bring coffee
to your grandfather.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.120
Bastien, a company doesn't thrive
on nostalgia, it thrives on profits.

27:50.840 --> 27:54.920
And if we don't act, we'll end up
compromising the whole law firm.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.160
In Spain and here in London,
we'll hold up, in which case,

27:58.240 --> 28:01.240
we'd have to say, "Bye-bye, San Francisco,
and bye-bye, Paris."

28:01.320 --> 28:03.520
Isn't it much riskier
to start new companies?

28:03.600 --> 28:04.920
What the hell is the metaverse?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Why do we have to invest
in these tech bubbles?

28:08.080 --> 28:09.840
Because it's the future.

28:10.800 --> 28:11.640
It's more cool.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.520
Nicholas, this isn't Google,

28:13.600 --> 28:15.760
and I'm no longer in a position
to ride a skateboard

28:15.840 --> 28:17.480
from my office to the coffee machine.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.440
Relax, Macías. We'll get you a wheelchair.

28:56.680 --> 28:57.560
Hey, wait!

29:03.240 --> 29:04.320
Coffee, anyone?

29:07.120 --> 29:10.240
Black, with oatmeal, matcha tea.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.680
Coffee, coffee.

29:17.560 --> 29:18.560
You can go in now.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.160
Go in.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.200
-I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.
-Restart process.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.080
I'm really all right. Can I go?

29:34.040 --> 29:35.360
Restart process.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.240
Real Madrid three, Barça nil.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.520
-You're tickling me.
-Yes, come in, sit down.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.640
-Where are you going? No. Stop.
-I'm perfectly fine.

29:44.720 --> 29:47.280
-Hey, cutie. Stop.
-Someday, we will rule the world.

29:47.360 --> 29:51.440
My secretary has reviewed your résumé,
and your profile is quite interesting.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.520
Do you know what we do?

29:53.600 --> 29:55.040
-Yes, you...
-Stop. Hey, hey.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.360
Stop meowing.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.440
You create and position content
in the metaverse.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.120
Stop meowing.

30:03.000 --> 30:03.960
Can I get you a coffee?

30:04.040 --> 30:06.440
-I don't want a coffee now. I don't--
-I'll go get it.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.000
-I think...
-Stop.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.280
I think I could contribute more
in the creative work.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.760
To the other side. Sudo kill. Sudo kill.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.440
-Should I come back at another time?
-No, it's already...

30:16.520 --> 30:19.480
-Stupid humans.
-It's fixed. It was worse before.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.280
We've met, haven't we?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.040
The guy on the flight to Ibiza.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.640
And the one on the motorcycle.

30:34.520 --> 30:38.560
That was you.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.520
You're great at mime.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.800
I'm telling you this as a professional,
I worked as a mime when I was young.

30:42.880 --> 30:47.200
Yeah. Well, I guess
this is the end of the interview.

30:48.800 --> 30:52.400
By the way, if you still have contacts
in the circus, I could use them.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.760
As you can see,
I was born to be a dumb clown.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.560
I take all the hits. Thank you.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.480
Fuck, it hurts!

31:14.560 --> 31:17.240
-Hold on. Let me see if I can...
-I can't take it anymore!

31:17.320 --> 31:18.600
It's going to rip my tits off.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.040
Wait! You're not going
to leave me like this?

31:22.680 --> 31:24.520
You carry on, I'm off to the physio.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.680
Can't you sleep?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.080
I haven't been sleeping very well lately.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.040
Too many things on your mind.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.680
And you? Why aren't you sleeping?

31:49.360 --> 31:51.800
I can't get used to this mattress.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.640
No one else complains?

31:55.640 --> 31:59.080
One of your friends
left this in the bathroom.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.360
They always leave in a hurry.

32:04.920 --> 32:05.760
By the way,

32:05.840 --> 32:09.400
I bought curtains in New Bond Street
for the apartment in Marbella.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.800
I'm looking forward to seeing it.
What time does your flight leave?

32:13.760 --> 32:16.520
I was thinking of delaying it
for a couple of days.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.280
Baxwell wants to meet with me.

32:20.280 --> 32:24.800
He suggested I come back here.
To the London offices. What do you think?

32:25.600 --> 32:29.280
It's not right that my personal attorney
is not a member of our firm.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.760
Why don't you accept our offer?

32:31.600 --> 32:34.440
Having you as my boss
would be the last thing on my list.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.640
Hey, you didn't tell me in the end
if you saw Noah at the wedding.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.640
Yes, we didn't talk much.
I'm going down to the gym.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.800
USING THE PRINTER IS FORBIDDEN,
EVERYTHING IS VIRTUAL

32:53.880 --> 32:56.520
-You left Martín's mandalas behind again.
-Thanks, Noah.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.160
-Is he still nervous at school?
-Yes.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.720
If he continues like this,
I'll have to buy a printer.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.560
May I?

33:10.640 --> 33:14.120
Come in. I was checking your corrections.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.160
The sales clerk is much friendlier now.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.440
And it sells better,
which is what matters.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.640
Good job, but it was for tomorrow.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.520
-Right.
-What about Amazon Music?

33:22.600 --> 33:26.400
It's been on your avatar's computer
for a week. An Easter egg.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.400
Are you trying to impress me?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.960
Actually, it's been there for a month.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.560
Do you remember the plane where we met?

33:34.440 --> 33:36.680
I was traveling
to meet with new investors.

33:36.760 --> 33:40.480
We need to expand.
I presented our strategic plan...

33:40.840 --> 33:42.880
but it didn't work.
I want you to improve it.

33:42.960 --> 33:46.160
But I'm neither a consultant
nor an economist.

33:47.160 --> 33:50.000
It's not a content problem.
I think it's the arguments that fail.

33:50.080 --> 33:50.960
EXPANSION PLAN

33:51.040 --> 33:53.320
I don't know,
try structuring it differently.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.640
Things are getting difficult
for the promising Leister heir.

33:57.720 --> 34:01.200
Today marks two days of protests
since the announcement of the closure

34:01.280 --> 34:04.440
of one of the most emblematic companies
of the Spanish holding company.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.320
The workers received
the letter of dismissal

34:06.400 --> 34:09.239
without anyone realizing
that the company had financial problems.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.800
JOBS
LET'S STOP UNJUSTIFIED DISMISSALS

34:19.880 --> 34:22.800
William, please.
Have you spoken to your son yet?

34:23.719 --> 34:25.360
You're a crook!

34:25.440 --> 34:26.360
Thief!

34:27.199 --> 34:31.560
You've destroyed my family,
you crook! Crook!

34:38.960 --> 34:40.800
You're going to pay,
you crook, you thief...

34:42.480 --> 34:44.199
Let's get out of here, please.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.480
WE ARE NOT DISPOSABLE
UNITED FOR JUSTICE

34:55.239 --> 34:57.520
Yes, this is how
they fire people at Leister.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.640
They're not content
to just give us the boot.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.360
You have four kids
and you just got into a mortgage, right?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.160
We need to turn back the clock.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.080
We can't.

35:12.160 --> 35:15.240
We'll transfer most of the people
once we open the new headquarters.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.120
But you know that it's his son
who runs the company from London now.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.120
But he doesn't have the balls
to show his face.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.680
We need to distract shareholders
from all this.

35:29.760 --> 35:32.160
Use the tabloids. Set up an NGO.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.920
Whatever, but you have to do it now.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.160
He thinks I'm your wife.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.160
You would be the perfect wife for anyone.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.520
My parents think the same about you.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.480
Should we see less of each other
so they don't get their hopes up?

35:57.240 --> 35:58.400
On the contrary.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.160
I think we should formalize
our relationship.

36:03.800 --> 36:04.640
Sorry?

36:04.720 --> 36:07.760
I'm tired of picking up cheap lingerie
around my apartment.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.440
Besides, we're both interested.

36:09.520 --> 36:10.400
We're interested?

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
The election is coming up soon.
Your father is running again.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.520
For show, he'll need you
to have a formal partner.

36:18.600 --> 36:21.360
You want to leak to the press
that we're together.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.920
That we're dating.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.040
Okay, what's in it for you?

36:29.720 --> 36:31.960
I may be in need
of a change of image myself.

36:34.120 --> 36:37.960
Yes, you're right. It wouldn't hurt you
to look a little more human.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.680
I didn't think I was going to like
the place so much.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.840
-Yeah, me neither. I didn't know it.
-Dinner was good...

36:46.320 --> 36:48.880
-Very tasty, indeed.
-The silverware was beautiful.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.960
And dessert. The dessert was quite good.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.000
I'm sorry, I started to eat
and I didn't leave you anything.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.280
You have a stain here.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.760
I should have worn
the chocolate-colored blouse.

37:12.840 --> 37:14.160
I don't know, Simón.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.840
I think I'd rather go a little slower.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.400
Me too, but I didn't dare tell you.

37:22.520 --> 37:23.480
Right.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.880
-And for dessert, a rejection.
-No, silly.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.160
Another day.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.040
Hey, the print toner has run out
and I don't know how.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.680
-Do you know anything?
-No, I don't.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.160
And this cactus?

37:37.240 --> 37:38.800
It gives me positive energy.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.280
You've sucked it all out
and only left the negative one.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.760
Tomorrow, the investors can't see this.
Guys, I told you.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.600
I want your desks spotless.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.640
Not too serious, not too geeky.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.080
When does Mr. Scrooge arrive?

37:50.160 --> 37:51.400
-8:00 a.m.
-So early?

37:51.480 --> 37:53.720
Will we have time
to roll out the red carpet?

37:54.200 --> 37:56.280
In the end, is it one investor or several?

37:57.120 --> 37:59.560
Do you want to know how many coffees
you have to prepare?

38:01.280 --> 38:03.360
Me, huh? Okay.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.080
Well then, whoever loses makes the coffee.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.920
-I bet you 20 bucks Noah wins.
-Come on.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Let's see...

38:16.400 --> 38:17.320
Whenever you want.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.880
What are you doing here?

38:45.360 --> 38:47.000
What are you doing here?

38:47.080 --> 38:48.880
I've just bought shares in this company.

38:48.960 --> 38:53.120
Yeah, well, I work here,
so I'm afraid I'm part of the package.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.240
You should focus
on your postgraduate degree.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.160
I'm capable of doing both.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.360
What's going on?
How do you know each other?

39:03.680 --> 39:07.200
I've invested millions in a company.
Not in an Irish pub.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.840
-Sorry.
-What is my stepsister's position?

39:09.920 --> 39:12.520
-She is a systems assistant.
-Coffees and photocopies, right?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.200
We don't make photocopies here.

39:14.880 --> 39:18.560
Look, the strategic plan you liked so much
was written by her.

39:19.280 --> 39:22.320
She's very good
and has a lot of potential, you know?

39:22.440 --> 39:28.200
I don't doubt it. But you do make coffee,
don't you? Can she bring me one?

39:47.600 --> 39:48.800
Hi, Sof.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.840
Hey! I thought we were eating out today.
Was your flight delayed?

39:52.920 --> 39:56.880
No, but something told me
I had to pass by the new company.

39:58.040 --> 40:02.160
It's chaos. I think I'm going
to have to stay longer than I thought.

40:02.240 --> 40:04.280
We're still a trending topic.

40:04.360 --> 40:08.240
I know. And the stock continues to rise.
It looks like our plan was a success.

40:08.320 --> 40:10.560
Like everything we do together, dear.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
All right.

40:13.640 --> 40:18.960
By the way, the new mattress has arrived.
Do you want to try it?

40:19.720 --> 40:21.360
-I'm sure it's fine.
-Come here.

40:31.560 --> 40:32.560
Sara.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.840
Thanks.

40:35.320 --> 40:38.480
Hey, sorry about the nickname.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.160
It was just to call him something.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.120
It was confidential.
I couldn't say his name.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.160
Don't worry, Mr. Scrooge is spot-on.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.720
Can you print out my exercise chart?

40:49.800 --> 40:51.680
I don't have time to go
to the gym this week.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.960
Coffee. Coffee. Does anybody want coffee?

41:08.040 --> 41:11.440
Black? With oatmeal? Matcha tea.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.680
So, are you going to go out with him?

41:25.160 --> 41:30.920
Well, maybe.
I don't know, he's funny, kind, calm...

41:31.000 --> 41:31.960
Predictable.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.480
Don't be mean. He's cute.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.400
And Nick?

41:38.200 --> 41:40.360
-I'm over Nick.
-No.

41:40.440 --> 41:43.560
-I have to turn over a new leaf.
-And you think that's easy?

41:43.640 --> 41:45.560
Well, yes, as easy as doing this.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.560
EXCLUSIVE: THE GOLDEN BACHELOR
SETTLES DOWN

41:54.160 --> 41:56.720
THE LOVE STORY
THAT HAS MOVED EVERYONE

41:56.800 --> 41:58.600
I should have kept quiet.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.000
-Did you know about this?
-Lion told me yesterday.

42:15.120 --> 42:18.960
Michael? How's it going?
I haven't seen you in...

42:21.040 --> 42:22.560
Yes. Very well.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.960
Is something wrong?

42:31.440 --> 42:33.760
Would you mind
leaving me in peace, please?

42:35.480 --> 42:36.800
Sorry, I just wanted--

42:36.880 --> 42:38.440
You're just fucking up my life.

42:40.480 --> 42:42.320
It was just a fucking fling.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.440
Don't tell your little brother
you've seen me.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.680
I don't want more problems.

42:53.880 --> 42:57.360
The defendant was videotaped
from the window of the adjoining building.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.320
You go on.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.880
Your Honor, cameras do not lie.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.720
Hi, Sofía, did I catch you at a good time?

43:03.320 --> 43:05.040
Yes, I was on a break.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.160
I wanted to talk to you about something

43:07.240 --> 43:09.680
that I'd rather not discuss
directly with Nick.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.800
And since you're now his... lawyer...

43:13.960 --> 43:16.480
Don't worry. What's it all about?

43:17.440 --> 43:19.960
Do you remember Michael?
My faculty counselor.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.720
Yes.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.360
What's your relationship with him?

43:23.880 --> 43:27.240
Nothing serious.
I may have pulled a few strings.

43:27.320 --> 43:30.000
That matter has nothing to do
with you guys. It only concerns me.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.680
That guy was a bastard. He and Briar--

43:31.760 --> 43:33.400
If anyone screwed up, it was me.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.440
So, please, I'm asking you
to leave him alone.

43:36.360 --> 43:37.240
Okay.

43:48.040 --> 43:50.120
-Pretty, huh?
-Very much, Petra.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.160
Thanks for coming.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.160
I was looking forward to seeing Maggie
after such a long time.

43:59.240 --> 44:02.920
Since it's the first time she's staying
to sleep and she adores you...

44:03.000 --> 44:04.920
I hope she remembers me.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.880
I'm sure she does.

44:07.960 --> 44:10.600
The poor thing can't comprehend
that she's Will's daughter.

44:10.680 --> 44:12.760
And, frankly, neither can I.

44:14.560 --> 44:16.920
Every time I think
about what happened that night--

44:17.000 --> 44:17.960
It's forgotten now.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.840
Forgetting is not the same as forgiving.

44:25.240 --> 44:28.720
-Do I look okay like this? Yes, right?
-You look very handsome.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.880
-Don't worry.
-No, Petra, Maggie can't eat this.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.720
She can, it has agave syrup.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.760
Don't worry.
I've made it hundreds of times

44:35.840 --> 44:37.600
for my husband, who is also diabetic.

44:42.520 --> 44:43.360
Hi.

44:46.960 --> 44:50.040
Hello, daughter. How was your trip? Good?

44:52.560 --> 44:53.440
Noah!

44:53.520 --> 44:54.960
Maggie!

44:55.040 --> 44:59.680
Hi, sweetie. You look so grown up,
and pretty. I love your dress.

45:03.160 --> 45:07.840
Okay, ready? One, two, three.
Pull, pull, pull! All right!

45:18.400 --> 45:19.720
You had an appetite, huh?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.960
So much so that I'm going
to take another piece.

45:24.040 --> 45:25.480
Can I have more too?

45:25.560 --> 45:27.480
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you.

45:27.560 --> 45:29.400
-You want some?
-I'll go with you.

45:29.480 --> 45:32.320
Hey, while you're at it,
can you get me a coffee?

45:41.000 --> 45:44.720
"The financial shark
devouring his own empire."

45:44.800 --> 45:47.960
What good does it do you to have a board
if you don't take their advice?

45:48.040 --> 45:50.160
What your grandfather
taught you is enough, right?

45:50.240 --> 45:53.240
You think the modern thing to do
is to act with an iron fist.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.240
Here. You take them.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.960
Right. Thanks.

46:03.040 --> 46:04.080
Here.

46:04.160 --> 46:05.520
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.680
I'd love to go to the party. Where is it?

46:07.760 --> 46:10.480
Do you want us to light the tree?
Watch. You'll see.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.280
Everything is controlled here.
From the phone, see?

46:14.360 --> 46:17.120
Man, I love that place.
The avatars go crazy.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.480
Do you want me to install the app
on your phone?

46:19.560 --> 46:20.920
Nick, can you help me?

46:21.000 --> 46:22.200
-What a pity.
-One moment.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.680
I don't have my VR goggles.

46:23.760 --> 46:25.960
See? This turns it off and on.

46:26.040 --> 46:28.120
Okay, that'll be best. Talk to you later.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.600
Your boss calls you outside of work.
That's not very professional.

46:34.680 --> 46:39.200
Same for you. What's my supreme boss
doing trying to control my private life?

46:40.240 --> 46:41.600
You're my sister here.

46:41.680 --> 46:44.080
Too bad you can't give me orders here.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.000
Nick!

46:45.080 --> 46:47.360
Just a moment, dear.
Let your father help you.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.440
Asshole.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.240
Damn syrup.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.200
As the memo that has reached you says,

47:14.080 --> 47:18.160
all subsidiaries of the Leister Group
must abide by the same regulations.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.080
It's silly, because I know
that many of you are not affected,

47:25.720 --> 47:31.720
but from now on, fraternization
between employees is strictly forbidden.

47:33.760 --> 47:39.560
So as not to be unfair, if there is
any relationship already started,

47:39.640 --> 47:40.960
now is the time to say so.

47:43.320 --> 47:47.400
That's all. Thank you very much.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.200
I hope this has nothing to do with Noah,

47:58.280 --> 48:00.640
but I think
you should have consulted me first.

48:02.240 --> 48:05.720
I knew you were a bad negotiator
when you dumped so many shares.

48:07.360 --> 48:09.920
Now I see that you are also
a bad strategist.

48:10.840 --> 48:12.720
Because you're giving yourself away.

48:20.800 --> 48:23.240
It's the same as last time.
I don't know if you liked it.

48:23.320 --> 48:25.920
I shouldn't try it again.

48:26.720 --> 48:29.440
It's an Olivia, the best French wine.

48:31.160 --> 48:35.480
Hey, before you go bankrupt because of me,
maybe we should talk about Nick.

48:36.560 --> 48:39.720
You don't want anything with him anymore.
He needs to accept it.

48:42.480 --> 48:46.280
He just won't stop. He's looking
for any excuse to throw you out.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.800
From your own company, Simón.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.480
I don't know. Maybe we should stop.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.640
I don't give a shit about my company.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.600
I'm not giving up on you.

49:08.280 --> 49:09.720
Elevator doors opening.

49:11.480 --> 49:14.200
Elevator doors closing.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.560
Elevator doors opening.

49:19.800 --> 49:22.000
Elevator doors closing.

49:29.400 --> 49:32.040
I've had them installed
throughout the office.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.920
They're recording 24/7.

49:35.680 --> 49:38.160
Gotta make sure
the rules are followed, right?

49:47.360 --> 49:50.240
Yes, I'm sorry. I've made my decision.
I'm going to do it.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.720
It's settled.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.240
-I'm sorry.
-Think about it.

49:53.320 --> 49:55.120
-No, Simón.
-At least think about it.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.200
It's the only solution.

49:57.280 --> 49:59.320
I've already decided, okay? I'm sorry.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.080
Here's my letter of resignation.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.160
Are you going to make a scene
like an angry teenager?

50:14.240 --> 50:15.320
I couldn't care less.

50:15.400 --> 50:16.280
That's your problem.

50:16.360 --> 50:19.280
You can't stop seeing me
as if I were still that teenager.

50:19.360 --> 50:20.600
Aren't you the same?

50:22.400 --> 50:23.840
I would say you are.

50:24.680 --> 50:25.760
The same eyes.

50:29.280 --> 50:30.440
The same lips.

50:34.040 --> 50:35.000
Same hair.

50:37.480 --> 50:38.320
Same tattoo.

50:39.280 --> 50:41.360
Be careful, there are cameras.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.480
Just as sarcastic.

50:43.560 --> 50:47.040
You're pathetic at trying to be
the same one you were back then.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.520
Why do you want to leave?

50:50.000 --> 50:52.160
If I have to choose,
I'd rather quit my job.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.000
So there's something between you.

50:55.800 --> 50:56.920
Look, I'm with Simón.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.400
Accept it just like I accept
that you're with Sofía.

50:59.480 --> 51:01.120
Who told you I'm with her?

51:01.200 --> 51:03.960
Fuck, all that's left
is to put ads on bus shelters.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.720
-Have you slept with him?
-And you with her?

51:07.240 --> 51:10.080
How many women since we broke up,
including myself?

51:12.120 --> 51:13.040
So you have.

51:13.880 --> 51:16.800
You can't reject me and then demand
that no one touch me.

51:19.320 --> 51:22.400
You have no feelings for him. I know it.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.560
If you don't know how to forgive,
learn to accept.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.680
Sometimes, the prey escapes the shark too.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.800
No, Morti, I can take it.

51:42.880 --> 51:44.360
No, miss, it's my duty.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.200
It's been a great vacation.

51:48.280 --> 51:52.160
Excuse me. If we want to make it,
we have to leave now.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.080
Yes.

51:53.600 --> 51:55.080
Nick has to take me.

51:55.640 --> 51:58.960
I think he must have had some problem,
but I can go with you, huh?

52:00.200 --> 52:01.800
Noah would be better. Can you?

52:02.600 --> 52:05.640
Sure, of course.
Shall we go in my car? Come on.

52:24.120 --> 52:26.000
I didn't know your mother was coming.

52:26.080 --> 52:29.240
Why don't you come and see us one day?
You can come alone.

52:29.320 --> 52:30.840
-Sounds perfect to me.
-Maggie!

52:35.400 --> 52:39.400
-I'm sorry. I couldn't get here sooner.
-You are very busy. It's all right.

52:39.480 --> 52:40.480
Hello, son.

52:43.720 --> 52:45.080
What are you doing here?

52:45.800 --> 52:50.360
Nicholas, give me five minutes, please.
It's about Maggie.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.080
No fucking way.

52:52.840 --> 52:56.840
Nick, talk to her. Please.

53:01.200 --> 53:03.200
I want a Green Juice.

53:03.280 --> 53:07.240
And my zipper won't close,
but a Bridget Jones.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.680
-Uh-huh.
-Thanks.

53:10.360 --> 53:13.080
Five minutes. Not one more.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.920
I'm going to give custody of Maggie
to her father.

53:17.560 --> 53:18.760
Which father?

53:18.840 --> 53:20.800
Yours. To William.

53:20.880 --> 53:24.640
-Are you going to abandon her like me?
-Don't worry. I'm not abandoning her.

53:24.720 --> 53:27.240
Then why the hell do you want
to give away her custody for?

53:29.360 --> 53:30.480
I'm sick, Nick.

53:33.640 --> 53:34.800
What do you mean, sick?

53:37.960 --> 53:39.320
I have leukemia.

53:42.840 --> 53:45.440
I've been struggling
with the disease for four years.

53:48.560 --> 53:51.800
So, when you put on that little show
at the gala, you knew.

53:53.080 --> 53:56.480
I just wanted to protect Maggie.

53:56.560 --> 54:01.200
To let your father know
she was his daughter. To let you know.

54:02.600 --> 54:05.440
Why should I trust you
after all you've done to us?

54:06.160 --> 54:09.960
Nick, I don't have much time left.

54:10.520 --> 54:13.520
Your father and I have already
signed everything.

54:13.600 --> 54:17.320
Maggie was going to come back with me,
but I got an urgent call for surgery,

54:17.400 --> 54:21.360
so I'm afraid you're going to have
to take her back with you.

54:22.480 --> 54:23.520
B.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.400
This isn't fair to her.

54:32.720 --> 54:36.880
I know you hate me,
but take care of Maggie.

54:40.760 --> 54:41.760
Do it for her.

55:05.120 --> 55:06.880
-How are you, my love?
-Good.

55:07.760 --> 55:09.960
-You're going back with Nick, okay?
-Okay.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.840
To the house. I've got things to do.

55:12.920 --> 55:14.960
You know how much I love you?

55:34.960 --> 55:37.360
If Maggie needs anything, you know...

55:44.200 --> 55:46.160
I don't want to be alone tonight.

55:54.080 --> 55:54.920
Please.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.320
It will only make things worse.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.320
Things can't get any worse.

58:36.200 --> 58:37.760
Nick!

58:37.840 --> 58:38.920
She's gone.

58:39.920 --> 58:41.400
She came to give me a kiss.

59:16.800 --> 59:20.640
-Good morning. How do you feel?
-Much better, thanks.

59:20.720 --> 59:21.960
Are you taking iron?

59:22.520 --> 59:23.360
No.

59:24.120 --> 59:27.080
Hasn't your gynecologist prescribed
any vitamin supplements?

59:27.880 --> 59:28.760
No.

59:28.840 --> 59:30.880
Have you been tested for toxoplasmosis?

59:30.960 --> 59:33.160
Not that either.
Why should I have it done?

59:33.240 --> 59:35.600
It's the most advisable thing to do
when you're pregnant.

59:38.600 --> 59:40.080
Pregnant?

59:41.840 --> 59:43.160
You didn't know.

59:44.880 --> 59:45.960
How?

59:47.280 --> 59:49.400
What you have is an intrauterine hematoma.

59:49.480 --> 59:50.440
That's why you're here.

59:50.520 --> 59:52.240
It's what was causing the bleeding

59:52.320 --> 59:54.200
that you may have mistaken
for menstruation.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.240
No, but that's impossible.

59:56.960 --> 59:59.040
You're 16 weeks pregnant.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:04.400
Sixteen weeks? No, but I...
I just, right now--

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.800
-It's impossible.
-You have a high-risk pregnancy,

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.800
so we're going to have to do
a couple more ultrasounds, okay?

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.880
Don't worry, because we're going
to take great care of you.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.520
What do you mean? He's the father.
He has a right to know.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.360
Do you know how many genes
the X chromosome contributes?

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.240
Nine hundred.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.480
And do you know how many
the Y contributes?

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.840
Fifty-five.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.680
For the little they contribute,

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.880
do you think it's worth
telling the father?

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.520
That's very deep, girl.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.080
-Thanks.
-Well, no!

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.240
-Nonsense is what it is.
-Really...

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.520
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.560
Did you say XY?

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.600
Is it going to be a boy?

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.760
Oh, God!

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.160
Well, we'll have to get ready.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.920
First of all, you need rest,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.360
so you're going to leave your shitty flat
and come here with us.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.240
And while you're painting your room
and the baby's room,

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.960
you'll stay in the guest room.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.920
You're not even going
to let me take it in?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.400
I'm going to be an aunt. "Aunt Jenna."

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.240
Sounds like an old lady, but glamorous.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.520
I'm starting to tingle.
I'm already starting to get excited.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.960
You'll see how excited
Grandma Rafaella will be.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.920
What a day I've had, my love.
I'll tell you about it later, huh?

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.800
Guess who's pregnant?

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.040
What? How?

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.720
Oh, my God, dude. Damn, dude.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.800
Fucking Seychelles waterfalls!
Really? Damn...

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.560
It's not me, you idiot. It's Noah.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.600
Shit, what a scare!

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.760
So whose is it?

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.960
Remember Operation Honor Attendants?

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.840
Well, now it's bearing fruit.
And never better said.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.520
Look at me. You can't say anything.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.400
Lion.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.480
-Nick doesn't know?
-No.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.120
And why are you telling me first, dude?
You know how... Wrong!

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.120
-So wrong, Jenna!
-Why?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.360
Because you know I suck
at keeping secrets. I struggle.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.320
I'm not going to be able to, Jenna.
Now it's inside me--

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.320
Do you want me to tell Nick how well
the waterfall went?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.480
I thought so.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.400
You're a blackmailer.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.840
-I love you!
-Blackmailer!

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.480
The surgeons have the special menu

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.160
and the psychologists and nurses
have the normal lunch.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.560
But that's not enough for them.
We also have to sit separately.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.560
Look... I've worked myself to the bone
to get here.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.120
I'm sorry about the case,
but there's nothing we can do.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.360
Do you know who's the bigger shareholder

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.440
of the company
to which this hospital belongs?

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.880
The Leister insurance company.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.760
Which has just been liquidated.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.080
We no longer have
the authority to intervene.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.560
What if I ask Noah?

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.160
Maybe Nick will listen to her
more than to you.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.480
They no longer have much
of a relationship.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.840
Really? It was my understanding
that they now work together at LRB.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.760
Didn't you know that?

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.760
And they must have seen each other before.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.760
Otherwise, I don't know
how this would be possible.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.520
They both posted stories
at Jenna's wedding.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.360
Date-wise, it's a match.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.280
I hope the press doesn't find out.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.080
Imagine the headlines.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.720
"Nicholas Leister, the model businessman,
the perfect boyfriend,

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.400
gets his stepsister pregnant."

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.000
And I'm not just talking
about the shares of his companies.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.240
How would it affect
your father's election campaign

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.800
if a scandal broke
about his future son-in-law?

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.080
You'll see how much fun it is.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.000
When Nick finds out,
he'll run like a puppy into her arms.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.760
I think I'm going to stay
in the hospital for a while.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.560
If you feel you need help
from a professional,

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.360
don't hesitate to make an appointment.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.320
How's your son, Esteban?

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.480
Good. Adjusting to the new school.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.520
Ah, no. I wasn't talking about Tony.
I was talking about Aaron.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.920
Aaron?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.160
He's good too.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.480
He's in marketing, isn't he?
In a subsidiary of yours.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.720
No. He got promoted to another company.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.960
Of the group?

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.600
Yes, from the group too.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:41.920
Which one?

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.200
The insurance company.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.400
He's out of a job?

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.720
Yes.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.520
Why didn't you tell me before?

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.800
-Don't worry. Next week, I'll call and--
-No. Don't bother.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.840
It's useless. He got in on his own merits
and you know him.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.080
He's very proud.
He's not going to accept any favors.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.600
I swear I didn't know that.
I really didn't.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.360
Don't worry, sir.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.480
What's Noah doing here?

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.760
I think she is dating Simón.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.800
Nick. Hello. Come with me.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.880
Simón!

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.920
A handshake to seal the merger.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.160
-I see you came with your girlfriend.
-And you with yours.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.640
Noah. How are you?

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.880
-Fine.
-You look very elegant.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.520
You are more than elegant, as always.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.920
I talked to Michael.
It's all taken care of.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.600
Thank you.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.920
I didn't know how Nick would react,
so I chose to come to you.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.480
You did the right thing.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.840
There are some things Nick is better off
not knowing, don't you think?

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920
You're dancing.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.600
No. I'm holding back the urge to pee.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.920
You can go to the bathroom.
I'll wait for you here.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.080
No, it doesn't matter.
They're usually pretty dirty anyway.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.320
I've never seen you dance before.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.560
Okay. I'll be right back.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.160
Barman. Give me another one of these.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.120
Is the choreography yours?

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:34.680
Very funny. What do you want?

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.840
Nothing. Are you okay?

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.840
Great.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.240
Hey, I've been thinking
about everything that's been going on

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:48.120
at the company with the cameras, and...

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.840
I went a little off the deep end.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.279
I hope it was recorded.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080
When you want, you can come back to work.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.720
You know how I hate your aftershave.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.800
Is that why you left the other morning
without saying anything?

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.359
I left because I don't like
being walked out on twice,

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:11.399
so it was my turn.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:18.080
-You don't know what I was going to say--
-Are you having a good time, Leister?

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.399
There was a long line at the bathroom.

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:22.279
-This is Sofía.
-Wow.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.840
Nice to meet you.
You're so beautiful, oh, my.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.479
Congrats. You're going to have
beautiful children.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.160
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.359
Hey, I've seen how you dance,
and you have style.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:42.040
But you need to loosen up a bit, girl.
Come on, I'll teach you.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.040
You just need to loosen up a little...

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.560
What the hell are you doing?

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.240
I still can't control myself
when I'm around you, Freckles.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.920
It's been happening to me forever.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.120
I'm going to the bar for a moment.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.360
-One second.
-Okay.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.640
Are you okay?

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.520
Yes.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.480
I think I ate something that made me sick.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.720
I want to go home. Can you call Simón?

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.280
Simón's in no condition to drive.
Okay? Come on, let's go.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.840
Why are you staying
at Jenna and Lion's house?

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.320
Because my landlord raised my rent.
I remind you that I am now unemployed.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.560
Boy, what happened to you? Did you eat N?

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.760
He's become a gourmet.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.800
I'll help you. Wait.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.280
If you want, I can stay on the couch.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.720
Please, let's not continue with this game.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.360
We're not the same anymore.
We've rebuilt our lives.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.880
You're going to start a family with Sofía,
the person you love.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.760
It's what your parents have always wanted.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.360
She's really great.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.280
And it's true,
you will have beautiful children.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.720
It could have been the same
or better with you.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.240
Could you be the father of my children
without forgiving me?

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.320
I think this is the moment
when our story really ends.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.480
I don't want it to end like this.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.600
Goodbye, Nick.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.200
Goodbye, Freckles.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.760
Breathe. You took too long to come here.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.520
YOUR CHILDREN NICK AND MAGGIE

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.120
Hello, brother.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.920
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.000
Poor Maggie.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.160
It's unfair to her.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.440
She's always been afraid of being alone.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.360
Sir.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.040
-Thank you, Martín. Just a minute.
-Okay.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.720
Maggie, look what I found.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.120
It was my favorite toy when I was a kid.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.440
It's a collector's item, you know?
Nick used to love playing with it.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.800
It's just that, well,
I never gave it to him. Do you want it?

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.880
No, thank you. There's no need.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.120
Wow, that's cool. May I?

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.600
Yes, of course.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.200
Stop!

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.760
You look unwell.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.680
We're at a funeral.
Everybody looks unwell.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.800
Oh. You have a fever.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.720
I don't know.
I must be coming down with something, Mom.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.840
Careful. It's a collector's item
and you'll break it!

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.920
What do you care if it's not even yours?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.720
It's William's,
and what's his is mine, right, Will?

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.680
Yes, of course it's yours,
but you can also share it, hmm?

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.080
Hey! Are you okay?

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.200
I hate him.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.920
Don't say that.
William loves you very much.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
If he loved me,
he wouldn't agree with him.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.480
Well, loving someone doesn't mean
giving in to their every whim.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.080
Sometimes, you have to know how to say no,
and William is your father...

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.000
No! He's not! My dad left because of him
and he didn't even come today.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.800
You know,
it's almost never one person's fault.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.800
And when you understand that,
you learn to forgive.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.320
I know William loves us both
very much, don't you?

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.160
We can't spend our lives rejecting
those who love us, can we?

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.880
Come on, go back to your cousins.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.600
Here.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.400
Thanks.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.880
Avoid the caramelized onion. It has syrup.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.800
Hey, when I talked to Michael...

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.480
Did you know he works at the hospital?

01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.520
What hospital?

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.360
He has access to your medical records.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.640
What does he know?

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:09.760
Enough.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.440
You won't be able to hide it much longer.
What's your plan?

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.200
Tomorrow, I'm going to Santander
to an aunt of mine.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.040
That's a long way away.
When are you coming back?

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.680
I don't intend to return.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.200
Anything you need, you can count on us.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.720
-Good night.
-Bye.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.920
Well, we sisters are going to sleep.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.280
Because we're sisters now,
did you know that?

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360
It's true.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.440
Bye.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.520
Thank you, honey.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.800
Good night, Dad.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.680
Good night, Noah.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.800
Bye, Dad.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.520
Good night, daughter.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.040
Can you hear the sea?

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.400
I love to close my eyes
and hear the waves.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.160
It's like feeling
that someone is rocking you.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.000
You know?
This room is like a huge conch shell.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.480
You can always hear the sea
even if it's quiet.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.720
You never feel alone in here.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.240
Do you like my room?

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.080
I love it.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.880
Well, as of today, it's yours.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.480
What about you?

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.160
Me... Well, make room for me when I come.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.720
The bed is very big.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.920
Thank you.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.160
Thank you, honey. I love you.

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.760
Hi.

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.440
Come in.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.640
You came from the funeral?

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:47.120
Has his mother's death softened him up
or is he still a bastard?

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.240
Hey, I wanted to tell you that...

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.520
I missed you.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.120
We talk every day.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:01.000
Wait. I have to tell you something.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.560
What?

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.320
Remember the MKO reporter?

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.280
There's been a staffing adjustment.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:19.280
My father needed to give his campaign
a boost and bought shares in the channel.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.160
When are the elections?

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.360
Next week. Why?

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.480
I was thinking of selling my apartment.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.840
Aren't you coming back?

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.960
Are you trying to tell me something?

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.280
I think it's better to break up now
while there's still time.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.360
Still time?

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.760
Of course. I've been a fool.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.600
I'm sorry.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.520
You can't forget Noah, can you?

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.320
The truth is, the gesture she had
with Maggie was incredible.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.080
I should have done it a long time ago.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.960
Impossible. You're incapable
of hugging your father.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.240
Your resentment prevents you
from doing so.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.360
Resentment?

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.560
It's the only thing that drives your life.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.360
Yes, Nick, the resentment.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.240
You blame your father
for letting your mother leave.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.400
And what do you do?

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.520
You punish him by dismantling
his way of running the company.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.120
His style is not very profitable.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.880
But it's more humane.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.120
And then you punished your mother
without wanting to listen to her.

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.520
My mother is dead.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.760
And what have you done? Tell me,
what did you do to stop her from leaving?

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.520
Nothing.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:42.920
Look around you, Nick.
Everyone has forgiven but you.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.920
All you have left is Noah.
And you know why you don't forgive her?

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.160
Because if you open your heart again,
you risk heartbreak,

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.040
but that's what living is, Nick.
Living is risking pain.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.040
-Do you think I don't suffer?
-Really?

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.520
You've always had others
do your dirty work for you.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.520
First your grandfather. Yes. Then me.
But I can't take it anymore.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.640
You have to face your problems alone.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:07.360
To keep you safe,
everyone else gets screwed.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.520
-I never wanted to hurt you.
-Well, you have.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.440
You've hurt us all.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:15.960
Especially Noah.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.400
When you've forgiven her, go see her.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.200
And don't try to hold on to Maggie
to make sense of your life,

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.600
because she doesn't need you anymore.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.320
The only one who needs you right now
is Noah, believe me.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.120
Why are you doing this?

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.800
I don't even know why I'm doing it myself.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.160
Thank you, Sof. I love you too.

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.240
-Let me try this here.
-No.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.480
-Let's see what it tastes like.
-You've already eaten yours. No!

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.760
Yes?

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.040
Simón! How is the new LRB headquarters
coming along?

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.960
I've decided to move to London
to be a little more hands-on.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.480
You're leaving?

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.160
There's nothing keeping me here.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.080
The new headquarters
must be put into operation

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.080
right now, with all the staff.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.000
With workers?

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.680
Yes. From the insurance company.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.640
The Sales force is left out,

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.760
but at least we can recycle everything.
Marketing, IT and Accounting.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.760
That's crazy. You can't use my company
to fix your screw-ups.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.680
It's in the agreement you signed.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.560
We both know the relocation was an excuse.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.480
I was always very serious about it.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.280
So now you care about others? Sure.

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.600
Hey, Ramón,

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.560
tell your friend that the bike's batteries
degrade very fast, huh?

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.080
You have to charge them only up to 80%.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.760
Then I can't make it to work.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.360
Well, that doesn't matter anymore.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.920
The conclusions of the case.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.520
No. No, no, no. It seems to me
that there's been a mistake.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.800
They should have called you.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.000
Please, sign and let's end this
as soon as possible.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.320
In a peaceful manner.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.680
Five milligrams is fine.
We'll check tomorrow.

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.720
Thank you.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:06.720
Hi, Michael. She's stable.
We've controlled the bleeding.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.480
Apparently, she's had
a similar episode in the past.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.880
She keeps telling me about her son,
but I don't see anything in her file.

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:18.560
I didn't dare sedate her.
I wanted you to examine her first.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.040
All yours.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.320
Hi, Briar.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.440
Michael! It's great to see you.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.560
I can't believe you're leaving.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.480
Yeah.

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.360
Goodbye, baby.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.600
Thank you.

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.000
Let's see where we can put this one now.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.560
Not in the trunk, you animal!

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.280
Who let it slip?

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.000
I swear I didn't.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.960
-Lion?
-Seriously?

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.440
I got a stomach ulcer from keeping quiet!

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.520
Noah!

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.320
What are you doing here?

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.560
Are you going somewhere?

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.440
It's none of your business.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.160
-I know it's none of my business, I just--
-Each to his own path.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.960
And I try, but here I am.
All paths lead me to you.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.280
That's a nice phrase,
but it's just a phrase.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.560
If you don't have
anything new to say, I'm going.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.600
Listen. Move, man.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.360
Hey, you haven't even said hello.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.880
-How are you? Good?
-Good.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:42.040
-What about my kiss? Wait!
-Listen!

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.320
You're the woman who-- Get out of the way.

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.560
Okay, I don't want to interfere
in such an awkward situation.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.480
Will you stop? You're making me dizzy.

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.800
I want us to start from scratch.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.720
Just you and me.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.520
Just the two of us?

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.280
That's impossible.

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:05.800
Impossible why?

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.560
This is an awkward situation indeed.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.600
Will you guys explain it to me?

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.440
You asked for it.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.560
What is that?

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.480
Is it clear to you now? Great, I'm going.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.320
-You're...
-Yes, she is.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.000
Okay, it's fine, it's okay.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.280
I don't care.

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.640
Okay, fine.
Since you don't care, I'll leave.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.480
No, wait. I do care,
it's just I wasn't expecting it.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.640
Wait! Noah, please.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.680
Please don't go.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.360
Noah, forgive me. I love you.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.880
I don't care about anything else,
and I mean anything.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.880
I don't even care that it's Simón's.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:08.760
Simón's?

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.040
-I'll love it as if it were my own!
-It is yours, you idiot!

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.040
What? Noah!

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.040
Congratulations.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.680
Sure, man. Get in.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.640
-Keys, come on!
-Okay, okay.

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:27.040
That felt so good.

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.880
This thing won't go faster, fuck.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.640
How beautiful.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:35.160
Beautiful? But it was torture.

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:36.160
Come on!

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.360
Noah!

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:43.280
Roll down the window!

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.480
What's the matter, Nick?

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.840
With all those chauffeurs
you forgot how to drive?

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.160
How far along are you?

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.240
Twenty-four weeks.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.240
How much is that in months?

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.160
-Six months.
-Six months?

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:56.600
Six months?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.080
At the wedding?

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.880
Yeah, don't do any more math,
Nick, it's yours.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.560
So... I'm going to be a father!

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.760
Yes.

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.640
No. I'm going to be a mother.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.560
Shit!

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.080
You can't walk away and throw me aside.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.160
You can take your 55 genes
and take them with you.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.760
It won't be very noticeable anyway.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.720
Fuck.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.760
Are you leaving the city?

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.640
Yes.

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:02.560
You can't do that.

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.120
And why not?

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.640
National Geographic
included it in its list

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.800
of the most charming places in the world!

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.960
Too many forest fires.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:14.920
I love you.

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.400
Come on, look ahead.
You have to pay us alimony.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.400
Yes, please.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.400
Wait. You're going to the mansion?

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.880
I can't leave without telling my mother
that she's going to be a grandmother.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.120
Nick?

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.000
Nick! Nick!

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.800
Nick! Nick! Nick.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:14.800
Nick!

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.400
Hey! Hey, you!

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:23.360
Nick! Please, I'm here with you,
okay, my love? I'm here.

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.680
I've been stupid. I deserve it.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.720
It's all my fault, Freckles.

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.480
No, enough with looking
for people to blame. Enough.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.160
Nick! Nick, Nick, Nick!

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.160
I'm here, I'm here, look at me.
Open your eyes, okay?

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.640
Esteban! Esteban!

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.040
-I've called an ambulance.
-No!

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.240
I'm not going to lose you again, Nick.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.600
Please.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.120
No, please. Please.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.160
-My son!
-Nick!

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.280
Nick. My love. Are you all right?

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.920
Hi, Freckles.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.240
What happened?

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.480
You've had a very long nap.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.760
Son, you've been in a coma.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.080
How much time has passed?

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.120
It's amazing.

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.200
I didn't know babies were so relaxing.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.160
He's perfect.

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.640
He's the most beautiful baby
I've ever seen.

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:07.040
I can't believe
you're finally here with us.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.360
You've done everything very well.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.760
Even the house. Our house.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.320
It's perfect.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.480
You've made me the happiest man
in the world, Freckles.

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:23.040
Remember when we first kissed in that car?

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:27.120
I was so nervous
that my whole body was shaking.

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:29.040
And you were gorgeous.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.600
Was it for me?

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.280
I give you my heart again, Freckles.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.040
It looks like the one I gave you
five years ago, but it's not.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.280
Now it has a little detail in the middle.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.280
-Wait, I'll help you.
-Don't worry.

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.040
-Dad should go to sleep for a while.
-More?

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:10.040
More. Isn't that right, my love?

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.160
Rest.

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:17.280
Goodbye, Mommy. Goodbye.

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.920
Don't worry, it's just the storm.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.600
Briar.

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.800
It's my turn. You go back to sleep.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.720
What are you doing here?

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.600
He just needs to be rocked.

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:34.240
Listen. Put the baby down, okay?

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.200
There, there, little one.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.960
Little star, where are you?

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.640
In the sky or in the sea?

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.000
A real diamond

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.320
Little star, where are you?

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.600
I wonder who you are

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.920
In the sky or in the sea

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.240
A real diamond

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:10.680
Little star, where are you?

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.040
In the sky or in the sea?

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:17.240
Yes, Nick. Mommy's here.
He's got your eyes.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.640
It's all right.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.880
You're handsome, huh? But not very smart.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.640
Nick!

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.280
No!

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.200
Noah!

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:11.800
Briar, let my son go.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.680
Your son? He's mine now.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.680
What are you saying?

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.360
You owe me. A son for a son.

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.240
We don't owe you anything, okay?

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.680
I won't allow you to enjoy
what I didn't have. No.

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.160
Please.

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.080
Come on. Go down.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.120
No, Briar!

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:32.280
-Briar!
-Go on!

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.680
-Briar!
-Let her go!

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.600
Briar!

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.200
Briar!

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.840
Let her go, you son of a bitch!

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.880
First, you get me kicked out of college.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.280
Then from the hospital.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.720
No one is going to hire me
with my background.

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.800
So I give up. You guys won.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.760
Soon I'll be out of this fucking country
and you won't see me again.

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:08.440
What's wrong, Nick?

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.240
Where is that bully inside you now?

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.040
-Get off!
-Stop, damn it!

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.080
Briar! Briar! Briar!

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.240
Thor. Thor, come on, inside.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.280
Come on! Go inside.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.000
Briar, please don't hurt him.

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.000
Don't do this to us.

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.400
Don't worry.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:49.080
I'm going to give him lots of love.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.560
You need help.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.960
I know. That's why I have Michael.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.040
You know what? You could use a scar.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:11.920
Your face is too pretty.
It would give you character.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.800
And you know something else?

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:14.720
Yeah?

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:18.640
If Thor senses you're threatening me,
he'll tear you to pieces.

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:49.160
You know,
I've always hated you since college.

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:06.880
Nick!

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:07.960
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:28.600
They say that
when you come close to dying,

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.680
your whole life flashes
before your eyes like in a movie.

01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.160
Or like in a book.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.360
Before my eyes...

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.120
I've always had yours.

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:52.880
When it wasn't what we wanted...

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.880
When we started playing around...

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.640
When we couldn't help ourselves...

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.040
When other people tried to stop us...

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.760
You're mine

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.280
That gaze

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.240
always kept us connected.

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.160
Until today.

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:33.080
Therefore, I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:40.240
-Hooray!
-Long live the newlyweds!

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:43.680
-Gorgeous!
-That's my brother!

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.640
You're beautiful!

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.840
One, two... and three!

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.280
Thank you.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.240
In the email you'll find
the airline tickets,

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.200
-the ferry tickets--
-And everything will be perfect.

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.120
Let's go, Noah.

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.880
Hey, Nick! I sent you
the location of the waterfall.

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.600
Goodbye, my love!

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.120
Hey, not so fast!

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.920
Change of plans.

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.000
No.

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.440
What a machine!

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.400
I owed you one.

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:38.440
Hey! You haven't recovered yet.

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.840
Besides, I'm going to spend
my whole life working

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.840
to pay off that loan, so I'm driving.

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.040
You don't believe it yourself.

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.200
You're still having aftereffects, see?

01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.320
Thank you, guilty, for being always there.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:02.360
Everything that will happen from now on
will be your fault...
