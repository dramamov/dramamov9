Please don’t be mad at me for not using my power on you.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.570
Try trusting our love.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.360
I think we’ll be fine.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.350
Mr. Ramil, you need to focus.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.970
Don’t forget why you came here.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.220
Are you real or just in my dream?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.750
Of course, I’m real, Punn.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.680
I really am.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.789
When will we see each other again?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.920
Someday.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.259
Remember my name.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.259
My name is

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.190
Ramil.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.440
So this is why I always dream about you.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.860
I’m the man in your dreams.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.320
You’re cheating by not letting me
dream about anyone else.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.340
Hey! Who do you want to dream about?

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.400
Tell me.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.110
No one else, Mr. Ramil.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.060
I only dream about you,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.420
and you’re the only one for me.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.330
Don’t forget our goal.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.500
Mr. Methus.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.980
Aaaah!

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.640
Punn!

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.290
Mr. Ramil.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.500
Punn.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.570
Why did you pull me back?

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.870
I was going to save you.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.580
That’s not what you should be
wasting time on.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.940
Don’t get distracted.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.170
From now on, I won’t waste time
on anything that’s not our goal.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.380
This isn’t it either. Let’s go to another door.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.130
Every time I’m scared of something,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.360
I see you.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.600
Every time I feel uncomfortable or sad,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.580
you’re there to comfort me.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.580
Maybe we’re together now
because of this journey.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.770
What are you doing, Mr. Ramil?

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.690
I’m going to ease the pain you felt back then.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.020
What are you doing up here?

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.860
You couldn’t sleep?

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.780
Yeah, I couldn’t sleep.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.660
So I came to get some roses.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.560
I was planning to replace
the ones in your vase in the morning.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.900
Don’t avoid my eyes, Punn.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.390
I’m reading your mind.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.680
Let me feel and understand your pain.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.060
Let me help carry it.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.450
So you’re the one who took my knife.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.690
I’m just trying to ease your burden.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.900
I’m sorry I got distracted and did this,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.340
but it’s really important to me.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:19.740
Everything that’s happened has led
our relationship to where it is now.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.580
I can’t ignore it.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.600
Thank you so much, Mr. Ramil.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.070
I’m so lucky to have met you.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.050
I’m lucky to have met you too, Punn.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:46.750
From now on, let me lead you
to our destination.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:12.740
Mr. Ramil, if you see me in the past, please
help me remember that you saved my life.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.500
Of course, Punn.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.480
I’ll make sure you remember me.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.940
I’ll make sure we meet again in the future.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.300
Punn.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.930
Punn, are you done? Come here.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.970
Sorry.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.550
It’s Pokpong’s birthday today.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.350
I don’t know if his new family remembers.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.540
During the Mass,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.150
I saw you sneaking glances at Jett.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.340
Shh, Punn!

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.490
Keep your voice down.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.420
Don’t let him find out.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.700
You see me like that because
I replaced myself in the memories.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:41.450
Even though it’s the past, you’ll see
my present self instead of my younger self.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.770
I know.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.670
I’m just excited to learn about your past.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.860
What happened that night was terrible.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.220
It was the night that started our conflict.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.370
I understand, Punn. I’ll stop it.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.790
Don’t worry.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.840
MICHAEL ORPHANAGE

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.980
Are you going to practice praying
in Father’s room again?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.780
Yeah.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.020
You go there almost every night.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.530
Are you sure you want to become
a seminarian?

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.380
Of course.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.660
Don’t you think it’s cool to be like Father?

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.540
I have to go.
I don’t want to be late to meet him.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:34.950
- Mmm.
- See you.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.680
This smell.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.320
Punn!

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.270
Punn! Punn, wake up!

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:33.840
Punn!

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.790
What, Elise?

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.360
They’re breaking in!

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.190
Is Jett still not back?

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.460
Elise.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.540
Hurry, Elise.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.410
Hey!

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.620
Let go of Jett!

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.530
Right now, both your past and future
memories are flowing into your mind.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.580
What a goofy vampire.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.270
Little Punn.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.080
I want to go back and face the problems.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.980
I want to make things right.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.750
No matter what happens, I’ll protect you.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.340
I’ll make you temporarily forget
what happened today.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.810
And I’ll leave a part of my mind‑reading power with you.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.870
When fate brings us together again,

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.800
and we touch,

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.160
my power and your memories will return.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.080
Ramil.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.800
Punn! What’s wrong with Punn?

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.420
Don’t worry, Pokpong. Punn is fine.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.630
It’s just a side effect of the power.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.890
So it’s really you, Feratu.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.740
Hello, brother.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.180
How did you end up in the human world?

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.630
I should be the one asking why you’re here.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:28.700
I summoned that thousand-year-old demon
to trap you with a curse.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.220
Yet, you still managed to escape.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.590
Is it because of…?

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:46.660
It’s so obvious from the way you’re protecting this kid that he broke your curse.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.690
I should’ve chosen him as my victim
instead of this boy.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.290
I made the wrong decision
waiting for the blood to brew sweet.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.940
But it’s alright.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.390
It’s not too late to drink his blood now.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.520
Master!

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.860
Mekhin, use your power to heal Master now.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.470
Go ahead and kill me.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.600
Don’t hesitate like last time.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.300
You know, these kids died
because of your soft heart.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.920
Because you just banished me
and spared my life.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.160
You’re trying to act like
a moral vampire, huh?

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.900
You’re completely unfit to be the leader.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.780
How many times have I told you?

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.620
I don’t want to be the vampire leader!

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.430
Liar!

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.180
If you don’t want to be, then let me!

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.140
Screw that damn tradition!

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.780
You’re not fit to become the vampire leader!

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.540
If not me, then no one!

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.920
Sleep for all eternity, Feratu.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.160
Punn.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.830
Master might be fighting with Feratu
in Mr. Punn’s memory.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.450
Will Punn be okay?

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.080
We need to find a way to get
both of them out as soon as possible.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.700
Wake up, Punn!

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.660
This journey has been a success.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.330
See you in the future.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.670
Punn!

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.620
Mr. Ramil!

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.720
Mr. Ramil, wake up!

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.080
Mr. Ramil! Mr. Ramil!

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.180
Mr. Ramil!

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:24.960
Punn.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.590
Are you okay?

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.390
I’m fine.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.190
I’m glad to see you again.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.550
You remember everything now, right?

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.760
I remember everything.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.180
Thank you so much for saving my life.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.810
Thank you so much for saving mine.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.180
Hey!

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.190
The others are here.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:41.460
So now you know for sure that
Father Dracul is really Feratu?

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.040
Yes.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.530
And you dealt with him, right?

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.720
I only used my power to
make him sleep for eternity.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.830
I couldn’t do anything else as I had to get Punn’s group out of the burning orphanage.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.620
So Feratu really survived.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:10.620
We have to find him and deal with him as soon as possible, so this can finally be over.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:11.860
Yeah.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.020
I thought you were going to die again.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.210
Ciar.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.890
Ciar!

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.930
Ciar!

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.140
I must really be dying.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.220
That's why I’m hallucinating like this.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.040
Stop playing with my heart already.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.690
It hurts enough as it is.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.740
It’s me.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.100
I thought you didn’t care about me anymore.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.310
How could I not care or worry about you?

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.930
You mean a lot to me, brother.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:56.980
Master.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.560
They’re just small wounds.
Stop being such a crybaby.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.560
You quack doctor. The wound doesn’t hurt.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.520
I’m just feeling moved.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.630
What? Not you too, coldhearted prince.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.380
Damn it. I should’ve just died.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.020
This is so embarrassing.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.230
Who’d ever let you die?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.200
Family is meant to stay together, right?

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.540
Ouch!

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.400
Be gentle. It hurts.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.340
Give it to me.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.990
I’ll do it myself.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.760
This is hard. I give up!

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.510
Let me help.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:25.060
I promise I’ll be gentle. It won’t hurt.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:29.790
Ouch!

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:31.540
Sorry.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:36.380
It’s fine.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.110
It’s fine.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.990
Can you… help me?

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.860
Please.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.860
You’re all better now, huh?

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.490
I’m healthy.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.640
I exercise regularly, so I recovered quickly.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.840
I thought it was because
Mr. Punn took care of and fed you.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:21.740
No.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.420
Wait, where are you going?

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.470
I’m going to pick Pokpong up from school.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.600
Why are you meddling
in their family business?

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.140
Where’s the kid’s brother?

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.920
Why isn’t he picking him up?

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.300
Or did he run away?

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.550
Typical human.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.620
They never keep their promises.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.850
He said he’d make me dinner.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.240
Where is he now? I’m hungry!

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.160
If you’re this cranky and whiny,

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.500
you’re definitely attached to Mr. Punn now.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.400
No way, you quack doctor!

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.400
Humans really can’t be trusted.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.540
That’s it. I’m giving him one last chance.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:02.720
Where are you, Punn?

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.210
Where did he go?

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.210
He never keeps his promises.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.420
Where did you go, Punn?

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.310
Punn! Where are you?

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.930
Ciar has been asking for you all day.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.930
It was hard to steal you away.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.930
Maybe he’s making me do all the work
just to mess with me.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.980
No, he just wants you around.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.180
He just doesn’t know how to say it nicely.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.010
Mr. Ciar is cute, isn’t he?

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:38.360
Hey.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.230
You always compliment other people
in front of me!

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.930
Now, will you stop sulking?

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.750
I just boosted your energy.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.860
I’m yours only.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.770
No one can take me from you.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.790
You’re cute.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.250
Mr. Ramil! What are you doing?

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.320
Mr. Ramil! Hey! Mr. Ramil!

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.460
What are you doing?

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.220
No!

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:28.540
Mr. Ramil!

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.220
I surrender, Mr. Ramil!

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.210
I surrender!

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.880
What were you doing?

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.420
Now we just have to tell Jett the truth,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.360
and then this will all be over.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.940
I hope he’ll accept and understand,

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.140
so the conflict between humans
and vampires can finally end.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.300
That depends on which way
the wheel of fate is turning.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.250
By the way, are you hungry?

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.490
Yes, I am!

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.100
Not like this.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.520
I’m talking about dinner.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:45.450
Mr. Ramil, I promised I’d make dinner today.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.780
Pokpong is coming over too.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.430
Don’t make me a human
who breaks promises, like Ciar said.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:58.940
Let go of me.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.500
I have to cook.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:07.730
Follow me.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.170
I’m going now.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.500
After they used their power
to control our minds last time,

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.190
I rushed to check our bodies

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.760
and found something unusual in our brains.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:51.870
So, I think their mind control power
is similar to interfering with brain waves.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.550
Based on that assumption,

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:58.060
I built a headpiece to block the mind control.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.610
Well done, Caster.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:11.020
This is exactly what will help us beat them.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.100
I’m so proud.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.120
But…

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.860
I haven’t tried it on real power yet.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.150
What? You jerk!

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.260
What? There’s no real power to test it on.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.990
Are you crazy?

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.960
Where would we find the power to test it on?

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:43.460
(We have a problem, Jett.)

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:49.090
(Father’s condition has worsened.
I brought him to the hospital.)

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.340
Okay. I’m coming right away.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:58.510
(I can now confirm that the priest
really is Feratu, Master Ramil’s brother.)

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.250
(This means he was the vampire
who attacked the orphanage that night.)

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.360
(Jett must be hiding him.)

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.900
(We need to find him before he wakes up.)

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.450
If I find where Jett is hiding that vampire,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.480
I’ll reach out to you right away.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:41.310
Hey!

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.960
What are you doing?

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.140
Give that to me.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.380
Stop it.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.420
Give that to me!

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.990
Hey!

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.890
You need to heat it up first.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.010
That’s how it’s supposed to be eaten.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:58.290
What? I saw Punn blowing on the soup
before eating it. Why heat it up?

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.030
Come on!

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.460
Actually, if it’s too hot,

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.330
it might burn your mouth.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.260
You might want to let it cool a bit.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.909
Then why make it hot in the first place?

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.560
That’s just how humans do it.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.530
That’s how humans do it?

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.780
So should we boil fruit juice
and blow on it too?

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.909
Are you crazy?

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:22.570
Give that to me!

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.620
Hey!

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.080
Stop it, both of you.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.370
You don’t want to spill it,

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.739
or you won’t get to try Punn’s cooking.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.170
Mekhin, can you bring the pot to the table?

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.820
Sure.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.360
And Ciar, you troublemaker,

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.400
bring the plates to the table.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:44.250
Now.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.679
Pong, don’t laugh at him.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.210
Bring the glasses to the table now.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.860
I apologize on Pokpong’s behalf
for all the trouble.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.370
This is heartwarming, just like family.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:30.530
Not just like. This is really family.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.530
Come on. If you’re ready, let’s dig in.

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:40.080
Punn made the soup himself.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.870
Pokpong and Ciar helped too.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.780
I chopped the carrots.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.550
I peeled the onions

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.180
and the garlic too.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.420
My hands still smell.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.070
Alright, that’s enough, guys.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.750
If you’re ready, try it.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.300
What is it, Elise?

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.540
Why did you follow me?

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.570
Are you hiding Father Dracul here?

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.360
What is it to you?

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.160
Father Dracul is not human, Jett.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.810
The vampire that attacked our orphanage wasn’t Ramil’s group.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:42.110
It was Father Dracul. He’s a vampire.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:44.630
That’s not true.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:54.210
Think about it. How many years have you been hiding him, lying there like a vegetable?

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.410
If he were human,
there’s no way he’d still be alive today.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.060
Move.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.220
Father Dracul is a vampire!

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.660
Figure it out, Jett!

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.350
Please wait outside, Sister.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.200
I need some time alone with him.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.740
It’s finally time to end this, Father.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.150
I’m sorry.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.460
Jett.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.660
Stop causing trouble already, Feratu!

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.420
Or else, I’ll—

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.920
Spare my life like you did last time?
