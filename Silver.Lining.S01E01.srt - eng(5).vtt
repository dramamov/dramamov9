Wang Yuya.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.480
Mom.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.240
Dad.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.600
Let me out.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.960
Accept your inner self.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320
You're a born criminal.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.840
I'm not.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.960
I'm not.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.920
Help me.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.800
Captain Luo, down there.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.120
It's a clay sculpture this time.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.520
A clay sculpture covering from head to toe.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.600
Stop looking.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.200
I've already taken one down.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720
It's Liuli again.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.520
Initial assessment indicates the victim is a young female.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.200
Likely similar to the previous two cases.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.840
But the crime scene has been severely compromised.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.000
As for the exact cause of death,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.880
I'll need to take the body back.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120
I can only give you answers after the autopsy.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.600
This is the third case in a month.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.240
The first two were a doll and a mummy.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.480
And now we have this clay figure.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.120
And it was pouring rain last night.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.520
This killer must be a complete psychopath.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.120
Never mind being a psychopath.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.780
Even if the sky falls, we still have to catch him.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.800
This guy is pretty cunning.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.280
Deliberately chose a rainy day to dump the body.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.410
All the evidence has been washed away.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.130
The killer has a unique artistic aesthetic for corpses.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.840
He probably sees the victims

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.840
as masterpieces worth showing off.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.520
I actually think

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.680
sometimes you should

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.920
think outside the police mindset.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.120
What are you standing there for?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.980
Clear the area.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.480
Send all non-essential personnel home.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.800
Move the police line back.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.060
Move along, everyone.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.200
Police investigation in progress.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.080
Another public place.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.120
Glass eyes.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.720
Who is this meant for?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.460
[Public Security POLICE]

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.820
[Homicide]

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.920
The person who reported this is quite elderly.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.120
They were terrified.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.970
What are you doing here?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.600
Everyone's back.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.120
Chief Chang.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.320
Let me introduce.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.440
Chi Xia.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.600
Top graduate from Yuhe Police Academy.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.920
Criminal psychology expert.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.440
Transferred from the provincial department.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.720
Here to work with us.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.640
Criminal psychology is a new field in our criminal investigation work.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.440
The provincial department is promoting it at the grassroots level.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.880
So learning and applying this new discipline

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.240
is both a political necessity

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.640
and a professional requirement.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.480
I hope everyone will learn from each other,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.440
trust one another,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.570
and take our criminal investigation work to a new level.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.840
Luo Xun, Major Crimes Unit Captain.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.840
Lin Wenjue,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.400
interrogation expert.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.240
Hello.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.080
Hello.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.520
Yu Lei,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.360
everyone calls him Curly,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.360
computer expert.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.080
Cao Bin,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.940
combat expert.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.320
Chief Chang,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.760
why are you throwing another young girl into the fire pit?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.840
Look at her delicate skin,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.900
thin arms and legs.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.120
Can she withstand the brutality of the Major Crimes Unit?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.080
Luo Xun,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.640
as criminal investigators,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.970
stereotypes are absolutely not allowed.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.320
Whether she's capable or not,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.520
we'll see on the case.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.800
Instead of wasting time, hurry up and study the case.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.920
It's already the third incident.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.640
The provincial department has been blowing up my phone.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.960
- Let's go to the meeting.
- Come over here.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.820
Come over here.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.200
Hold my cup.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.240
October 16th.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.700
We received a case report.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.340
The victim, Zhang Wen,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.680
25 years old,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.610
a bank employee.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.640
Her husband, Zhao Ziqiang, due to frequent business trips,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640
the couple was

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.300
living apart from each other.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.480
After Zhang Wen's death,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.360
she was turned into an exquisite doll by the killer.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.960
Abandoned at the entrance of a clothing store.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.640
Call the police! Let's go!

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.600
November 5th.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.200
We received the second case report.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.040
This case was reported

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.240
20 days after the first one.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.560
Victim: Lin Wei, female,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.120
25 years old, teacher.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.640
Also a single woman who lived alone for a long time.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.240
After being killed, she was mummified by the murderer

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.700
and dumped in a reservoir.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.570
What is that?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.320
Is it a body?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.040
Call the police! Let's go!

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.360
November 15th,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.400
which is today.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.880
We received the third case report:

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.880
a body dumped in the park square.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.800
This case was reported

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.659
just 10 days after the second one.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.380
The victim is also female.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.720
She was turned into a clay sculpture.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.920
Both eyes of the victim were removed,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.160
replaced with spherical

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.640
or rhombus-shaped objects of similar size and color.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.280
All made of colored glass.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.120
Judging from the incisions around the eyes,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.780
the killer's technique is skilled and precise.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.360
Looking at the timing of the crimes,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.840
if it's the same person

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.600
or the same group,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.600
committing three crimes in a single month

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.050
it's extremely brazen.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.960
Through surveillance footage, we discovered

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.160
that the first two victims had one thing in common:

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.039
they both visited the Huixin Shopping Center.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.679
We've interviewed many shop owners,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.809
but no one indicated

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.840
having any recollection of the two victims.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.700
Additionally,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.159
in both victims' homes,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.800
we found paintings signed by someone called 'Mr. D'.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.160
There might be some connection.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.640
The biggest challenge we're facing now is that

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.120
due to the clay sculpture causing disfigurement,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.120
we cannot quickly

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.560
identify the third victim,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.960
which means we temporarily can't find

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.220
any connection to the first two victims.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.320
Chi Xia.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.930
What are your thoughts?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.280
Jue.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.200
Thanks.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.840
The body is relatively intact,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.160
with no visible impact injuries on the surface.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.420
This proves that when handling the body,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.280
the killer has considerable strength and physical ability.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.440
The victim's hair,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.640
nails and other details have been carefully processed,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.640
proving the killer is quite appearance-conscious

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.600
and has some obsessive tendencies.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.640
The body has a unique artistic quality,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.960
suggesting the killer may have received formal aesthetic education.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.920
The traditional glass inlaid in the victim's eyes

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.920
indicates the killer has significant financial resources.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920
Based on all this,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.320
I believe we can preliminarily determine

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.440
that the killer is a young to middle-aged male.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.900
Outstanding appearance.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.080
Has certain cleanliness issues or OCD.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.800
Comes from a well-off family,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.920
received higher education,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.200
even studied abroad,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.880
and has a flexible lifestyle.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
With relatively unrestricted movement patterns.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.640
I just took a look

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.000
at Mr. D's paintings in the first two victims' homes.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.320
I don't think it's a coincidence.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.640
The third victim's home

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.080
might also have similar items

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.120
or items with the same significance.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.720
I think everyone should pay attention to this.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.280
Does anyone have any questions?

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.360
If not,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.320
I'll ask one.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.880
Luoxun.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.360
How many days to solve this case?

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.130
Whatever you say, boss.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.600
Alright.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.920
10 days.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.180
Getting impatient again.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.800
You're the captain now,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.200
why can't you keep your cool?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.440
A well needs pressure to produce oil.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.240
A cop needs pressure to solve a case.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.520
You, Luoxun, are best at tough battles.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.880
I believe in you.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.640
Fine.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.920
10 days it is.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.440
Here's the autopsy report.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.200
Take a look.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.640
Based on our preliminary assessment,

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.880
the victim's time of death

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.920
was between 12 and 18 hours ago.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.480
Although sleeping pills were found

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.320
in the victim's system,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.920
there was also

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.560
a significant amount of soil in her mouth and nose.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.160
Therefore, the actual cause of death

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.880
was most likely mechanical asphyxiation.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:30.720
So...

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.720
If it was mechanical asphyxiation,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.440
but there aren't many signs of struggle on her body.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.400
This indicates that before she suffocated,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.760
she had already lost the ability to resist.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.320
But I just noticed

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.400
there's soil under her fingernails.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.640
These two points contradict each other.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.400
So next,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.960
we need to test

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.280
the soil composition under the victim's nails.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.280
Give me some time.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.920
And the scratches on her arms

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.040
weren't found on the first two victims.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.560
If the test results can prove

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.840
these marks were made during a struggle

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.960
from scratching...

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.560
Wait.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.530
What's her name?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.880
Chi Xia, right?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.160
Your analysis is all just speculation.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.880
Can we hear the medical examiner's professional conclusion?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.760
Before the detailed autopsy report

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.760
and DNA comparison results come out,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.120
let's intensify our investigation

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.200
to confirm the victim's identity. Let's go.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.000
Captain Luo.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.520
I don't think going out to investigate without any leads

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.560
is a wise choice.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.620
We don't have that much time to waste.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.600
Then tell me how I should investigate.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.320
It's not about me teaching you how to investigate.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.280
At least I think

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.120
we should use the characteristics of the third victim

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.760
and the commonalities with the previous two victims

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.160
to narrow down the scope.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.280
You make it sound so easy.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.090
How do we narrow it down?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.970
Based on your wild guesses?

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.420
You don't trust me.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.800
Then let's have a competition.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.880
Let's see who can find information on the third victim first

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.920
and their connection to the previous two victims.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.280
If I lose,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.280
I'll leave the Major Crimes Unit immediately.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.160
Deal?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.770
[Victim's clothing detail photo (with pollen)]

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.400
Ning, listen.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.800
There's a new discovery.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.200
The third victim's heart

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.600
had coronary intervention surgery

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.360
in our area.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.920
Only the City Central Hospital can perform this surgery.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.760
Okay, got it.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.920
Let's go to City Central Hospital.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.250
Okay.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.720
Cao Bin, Curly, let's go.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.740
Sure thing.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.760
Thank you both.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.420
No problem.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.640
Sorry, I was in such a hurry with the delivery.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880
Are you okay?

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.200
Are there really flower shops that offer delivery service?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.080
They're rare,

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.250
but such flower shops do exist.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.680
I know a colleague who runs one.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.960
To save money,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.680
she opened her flower shop in a warehouse.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.340
It's called Lili Flower Shop.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.880
Do you have her contact information?

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.560
No,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.920
but I know the owner's name is Chen Li.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.600
Chen Li,

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.650
the Chen with 'ear' on the left.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.120
These four people best match the criteria.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.520
What's up, boss?

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720
Found something?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.680
Is it possible?

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.860
This is the most likely match.

always trying to prove themselves in unusual ways.

Why don't we provoke him to commit a crime?

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.280
Do you realize

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.940
you're playing with potential victims' lives?
