00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.780
Captain Luo

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.600
I found information about the third victim.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.660
Her name is Chen Li.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.240
Chi Xia

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.800
According to Dr. Ning's information,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.400
we've already visited Chen Li's home based on hospital records.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.600
I also checked her social media accounts.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.800
She liked Mr. D's artwork,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.440
and all these paintings contain clay sculpture elements.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.170
I think this is her connection to the two victims.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.210
Unfortunately,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.800
we didn't find any information

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.930
about the paintings at Chen Li's home.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.720
You, me, everyone,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.800
in our daily lives,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.160
when we come across something interesting,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.620
we all hit the like button.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.320
Right?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.840
Yes.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.520
So this doesn't prove anything.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.320
What?

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.000
Is this your excuse for not accepting defeat?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.080
I lose.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.800
The reason you haven't found anything relevant

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.200
is because

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.680
the key to this matter isn't the painting itself,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.680
but the meaning conveyed by the painting.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.800
I believe that in Chen Li's home,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800
there must be items with the same significance.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.000
Well...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.280
Why don't we just call it a tie?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.919
Right?

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.360
The meaning of the painting.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.600
That's your definition.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.400
What's the point of all this?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.440
Captain Luo.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.160
If you really care about this case,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.800
please listen to my suggestion.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.200
Let's search Chen Li's home one more time.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.840
What if we find something new?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.360
Instead of ignoring potential clues

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.730
and just arguing about who's right or wrong here.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.360
Chi Xia.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.280
Have you ever been to a crime scene?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.079
Do you know how to find evidence?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.440
You're not suitable for the Major Crimes Unit.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.360
I'll go talk to Chief Chang right now to get you transferred.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.800
Jue, I think

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.920
I need to trouble you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.200
to check the social media accounts of these three victims

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.680
and look for commonalities.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.010
Okay.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.360
Chi Xia

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.000
Luo Xun just has a short temper.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.360
Don't take it personally.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.320
I don't mind.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.090
What are you doing here?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.130
Oh my god!

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.210
I should be the one asking you that.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.840
Didn't you think I was wrong?

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.360
Why do you suddenly think I'm right now?

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.970
Special cases require special handling.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.680
From her living situation,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.810
Chen Li lived alone.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.800
Has anyone seen her family?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.360
Her parents

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.200
died in a traffic accident

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.959
two years ago.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.800
As for people who knew her,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.000
we've asked them too.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.240
No one has seen paintings similar to those of the first two victims.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.520
How can you be so sure

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.260
that these paintings are the common factor in all three cases?

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.440
Is this all the information?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.560
Why don't you just wait until you solve the case to tell me?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.200
Right.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.360
Captain Luo is so experienced,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.600
even without any help,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.400
you'll definitely solve the case within ten days.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.980
Is there a problem?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.159
This is the same rabbit, isn't it?

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.760
Captain Luo,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.820
I found information about this Mr. D.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.280
Just a moment.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.800
This Mr. D is a foreign

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.800
healing-style artist who isn't very famous.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.000
He has a series of paintings called 'The Seekers of Help.'

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It's gained quite a following among depression patients.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.800
The two paintings found at Lin Wei and Zhang Wen's homes

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.000
are from this series.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.980
Then last year,

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.000
the paintings from this series

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.920
were purchased at a high price by a domestic collector.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.280
The buyer's identity is currently unknown.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.240
But just last month,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.600
there was an exhibition hall in our city called 'Gezi'

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.200
that displayed these works.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.570
Okay.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.640
Mom.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.640
Mom!

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.520
Where are

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.080
you guys?

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.520
Fellow students,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.680
today is a very special day.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.000
Today marks the perfect conclusion

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.360
of our four years of college life.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.640
One, two, three, cheese!

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.240
OK.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:41.760
Hello.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.840
Hello.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.880
I'm from the Criminal Investigation Unit of Dongzhou Police Department.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.880
Are you a family member of Lin Yushan and Yang Shujun?

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.440
Yes.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.860
I regret to inform you that

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.280
Lin Yushan and Yang Shujun have passed away in a fire.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.320
Please accept my condolences.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.080
We need you to come over now.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.480
Captain Luo.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.600
Last night, Chi Xia and I

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.760
conducted a second search of Chen Li's home.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.760
We found this,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.560
an invitation from Gezu Exhibition Hall

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.200
for the Drowning Victims Exhibition.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.680
The date was October 14.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.800
After that,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.200
three victims appeared one after another.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.440
After our verification,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.000
In this Drowning Victims Exhibition,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.480
Mr. D's 'Rescuers' series of paintings are being displayed,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.480
which is the most direct connection between the three victims.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.680
This is it. The Jiazi Exhibition Hall.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.880
Let me add something.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.840
Besides all being connected to

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.680
the Jiazi Exhibition Hall,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.460
the three victims have another thing in common:

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.040
they're all 25 years old.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.540
I have another clue to add.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680
Yesterday, Chi Xia

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.360
reminded me

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.240
to check the social media accounts of the three victims.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.640
And I did find something.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.240
These three victims

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.560
2. After police authorities complete adjustments to items left at internal and external medical plaza with 2% therapeutic status, this form shall be issued to the civilian medical institution.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.000
You can clearly see in their social media accounts

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.480
that they all had a sad and dark past,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.240
to the point that

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.560
the content of their social media accounts was quite negative.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.640
But just recently.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.580
Take a look.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.680
These three people

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.320
have all simultaneously started showing a positive attitude toward life.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.180
Unlike before.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.100
That's exactly it.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.680
If I were the killer,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.010
I would also wonder why.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.360
We're all people living in the abyss,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.480
why can some people escape from the mire

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.440
while I cannot?

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.120
So I want to destroy. I want to demolish.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.400
The focus of our investigation next

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.330
should be on each exhibition hall.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.200
Let's see if there's anyone matching what you analyzed

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200
in your first meeting

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.000
who fits the suspect's profile.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.680
Welcome. Please come in.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.890
Everyone's inside.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.340
Just walk straight in.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.820
Let me get this for you.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.320
Thank you.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.000
Hello. How may I help you?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.680
Which one is your director, Zhou Yanchen?

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.880
You're looking for Director Zhou?

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.280
Director Zhou is inside.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.880
You're too kind.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.880
Please go ahead and look around.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.380
Director Zhou.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.680
Hello. And you are?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.840
We're detectives from the Major Crimes Unit of Dongzhou Police Department

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.040
and we need your cooperation with a case.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.840
Alright.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.720
Officers,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.200
shall we talk outside?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.880
Director Zhou, these are refreshments prepared for your guests.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.040
Let me know if you need anything else.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.970
Good, thank you.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.680
Officers,

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.720
may I ask what brings you here today?

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.100
It's like this.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.760
Recently in our city

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.890
there have been three serial murders.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.720
The victims

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.800
are all more or less

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.000
connected to a series of paintings called 'The Supplicant.'

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.770
The artist of these paintings is called Mr. D.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.450
These paintings were previously exhibited here, correct?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.800
That's right.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.900
They were exhibited just a month ago.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.560
From what we understand,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.680
these paintings are quite expensive in the art market.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.480
The victims who owned them

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.800
actually couldn't afford to buy such artwork.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.600
So we came specifically to ask you about this.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.360
Well,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.700
it's like this.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.480
This series of paintings

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.480
consists of twelve pieces in total.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.210
I collected all of them.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.360
When they were exhibited a month ago,

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.680
I was fortunate enough

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.010
to meet several young women who genuinely appreciated art.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.240
So I gave the paintings to them as gifts.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.040
To be honest with you,

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.760
if I continue to meet people with whom I feel a connection,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.720
I plan to give away all twelve paintings.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.720
Director Zhou, you look quite refined,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.080
but I didn't expect you to have such a street-smart attitude.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.040
Thank you.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.320
These two paintings

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.720
must be created by

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.050
the renowned master Edvard Munch, right?

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.010
This one, The Scream, is one of his most famous works.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.840
His works

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.570
all have strong subjectivity and a melancholic, depressing tone.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.040
However, as far as I know,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.320
this Adam and Eve painting should have blank, expressionless eyes.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.680
Were their eyes

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.280
added by you, Director Zhou?

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.440
It seems this female officer

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.480
knows quite a bit about art.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.200
All paintings in my gallery are originals,

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.200
except these two which I reproduced myself.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.240
You're right.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.240
Adam and Eve are common subjects in Western paintings.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.080
But this particular one is especially unique.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.880
But altering classics so casually,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.340
don't you find it disrespectful?

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.760
Director Zhou doesn't seem to be someone who truly loves art.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.920
But I understand.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.240
Children from wealthy families

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.200
always want to prove themselves by taking unconventional paths.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.320
Loving art

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.240
is just a facade for their refusal to admit defeat.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.170
Don't you think?

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.040
Officer, casually defining others

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.080
is also disrespectful.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.200
I've never exhibited this painting

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.480
nor used it commercially.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.040
I welcome anyone

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.360
to have different interpretations.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.820
But what I don't welcome is

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.440
any malicious insinuations.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.800
Also,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.640
officers,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.290
rather than wasting time discussing art with me,

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.360
why not focus on finding the real culprit?

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.120
At this very moment,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.720
another victim might be in danger.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.240
You wouldn't want

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.810
tomorrow's headlines to be about this again, would you?

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.880
This guy looks calm

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.700
but can't hide that darkness and ruthlessness inside him.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.760
And his casual movements

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.760
reveal his almost obsessive cleanliness.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.440
He values art extremely highly,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.960
almost to the point of obsession.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.760
You can see all this in his micro-expressions.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.490
In short, I think

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.970
Zhou Yanchen should be our prime suspect.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.530
He's extremely confident,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.800
and his blatant provocations

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.160
are also manifestations of his theatrical personality

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.120
and his desire for attention.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.520
This indirectly suggests he might commit another crime.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.300
Chi Xia, you just say whatever comes to mind.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.410
Captain Luo,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.890
why don't we provoke him into committing a crime?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.480
Provoke a crime?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.960
Yes,

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.040
provoke him to commit a crime.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.500
We'll catch him in the act.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.760
Are you serious?

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.530
Have you considered the risks?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.360
Do you realize

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.090
you're gambling with potential victims' lives?

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.360
If we can't find evidence to convict Zhou Yanchen,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.560
then we keep looking.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.240
Are you Chi Xia?

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.500
Yes, that's me.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.320
Please come with us to the prosecutor's office to assist with an investigation.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.040
I'm Luo Xun, head of the Major Crimes Unit.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.680
You can talk to me about any issues.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.440
Captain Luo,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.960
mind your attitude.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960
Mind my attitude?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.200
You barge into the police station without notice,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.920
trying to take away one of my team members,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.840
and you're telling me to mind my attitude?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.280
Comrade, don't misunderstand.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.360
We were just discussing the case

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.690
and got a bit emotional.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.800
Please excuse us.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.530
Captain Luo,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.080
I'm Xu from the Dongzhou Prosecutor's Office.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.320
We've worked together before.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.120
I know you.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.920
Captain Luo,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.100
can we talk privately?

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.800
If you're going to make this official, then save it.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.760
Prosecutor Xu,

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.160
I've just started working on a troublesome case

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.490
and I'm short-staffed.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.000
I can cooperate with your work,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.130
but you need to give me an explanation.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.560
There's a death row inmate named Tu Guo'an

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.960
who attempted suicide in detention last night.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.490
We've checked the records.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.319
Chi Xia met with him a couple of days ago.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.280
You carry such deep sins.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.520
People like you deserve to be flayed alive.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.119
Is he really your biological son?

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.680
This kind of emotion needs an outlet.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.010
He'll definitely choose to kill someone else immediately.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.610
