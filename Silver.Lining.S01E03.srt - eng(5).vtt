Wang Yunya

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.760
Five years ago in Dongzhou,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.200
346 Pingjiang Road,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.920
the Zhou family massacre.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.840
You claimed that while repairing an air conditioner, you got into an argument

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.100
and then killed all five family members.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.420
Is that really what happened?

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.280
The youngest victim at the scene

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.740
had a wooden carving of a cat in their pocket.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.039
Later, the police found

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.440
many similar wooden carvings at your home.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.080
Cats.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.840
Do they have

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840
some special meaning to you?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.720
The girl brought a cat home that day.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.000
Her family was allergic to cat hair,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.259
so cats were never allowed in their home.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.160
So they killed the cat.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.020
You witnessed everything

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.840
and on behalf of that cat,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.160
you judged them.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.720
One cat,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.600
five human lives.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.360
Quite a bargain.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.800
Bullshit!

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.530
How the hell would I kill people over a cat?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.000
Three days after the Zhou family massacre,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.930
there was a fire across the street.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.880
In the home of the deceased Lin couple,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.009
similar cat carvings were also found.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.400
Strangely enough,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.560
their cat wasn't found dead at the fire scene,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.760
but disappeared.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.400
You love cats so much.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.040
Where do you think

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.320
the cat went?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.400
Officer,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520
I don't feel well.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.160
I want to end this interview.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.360
I'm not feeling well.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.600
Officer.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.240
We're actually the same kind of people.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.040
Tu Guo'an yesterday

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.360
suddenly felt unwell.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.800
When the doctor came in for diagnosis,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.880
he grabbed medical scissors.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.140
He cut his major artery

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.020
and almost couldn't be saved.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.000
As the last person who saw him,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.100
shouldn't you tell us something?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.000
Tu Guo'an's death sentence was upheld in the second trial

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.920
and has been sent to the Supreme Procuratorate for review.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.579
It could be issued at any time.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.960
Why would he choose to commit suicide now?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960
Good question.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.690
That's what we want to know too.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.440
Before Tu Guo'an's suicide attempt,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.280
did he reveal anything

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.940
about the details of the Lin couple's fire case?

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.720
Did he mention the cat woodcarving

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.780
and its connection to the Lin couple?

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.140
Are you suggesting

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.480
that Tu Guo'an

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.600
is involved in other unsolved cases?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.240
Who are you?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.600
Why are you following me?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.330
Cut the crap.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.800
Hand over your money.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.040
See what this is?

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.080
If this knife goes into your artery,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.520
even God couldn't save you.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.450
I suggest you hand over your money.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.560
Let go!

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.079
Let go or I'll kill you!

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.360
Call everyone you know.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.019
Let them all come at me.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.520
You're just a junkie.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.740
Who would help you?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360
As for me,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.000
I've never been one to follow the rules.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm in a bad mood today.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.250
You're unlucky to have run into me.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.600
But I'm just like you.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.170
I also enjoy hearing a knife

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.360
pierce through an artery.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.060
Why don't you try it for me?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.440
Don't try to scare me.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.340
This is a society ruled by law.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.520
If you've got the guts, just kill me.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.760
Rule of law?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.560
There are no surveillance cameras around this alley.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.080
The police won't go to great lengths for someone

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.240
who's already dying from addiction.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.120
Your death

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.120
doesn't fall within the scope of the rule of law.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.240
Bullshit!

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.740
How could I possibly kill someone over a cat?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.720
You've got nerve.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.400
Want a quick death, is that it?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.800
You carry such deep sins

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.600
and you dare hope for an easy way out?

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.680
People like you deserve to be flayed alive.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.170
To taste what it's like when you can't live

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.840
and can't die either.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.880
Officer Chi,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.680
what difficult case are you working on?

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.920
Need any help?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.490
What a coincidence.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.760
Yeah, right.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.060
Hands on your head and squat down.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.120
You don't seem right.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.220
I'll take care of this person.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.159
Go home first.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480
Hey.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.330
Are you in Dongzhou?

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.460
Can you help me investigate someone?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.260
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.920
Thank you.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.620
I wasn't in a good mood last night,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.650
so I might have caused you trouble.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.520
I'm sorry.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.120
It's fine.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.360
By the way,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040
Xu mentioned that

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.300
death row inmate who attempted suicide.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.170
What's your connection to him?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.930
There's no connection.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.890
Is there some misunderstanding here?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.580
Let me help you sort it out.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.920
Also,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.600
how did they interrogate you yesterday?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.730
How much stress did they put you under?

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.220
There's no misunderstanding, Captain Luo.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.840
It's okay. There's no misunderstanding.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.800
The prosecutor's office shouldn't have approached you.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.160
When has our Major Crimes Unit ever suffered such humiliation?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.080
I'll speak to their supervisor right now.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.840
Captain Luo.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.120
He's just a sample for my criminal psychology

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.850
research project, that's all.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.340
No need to make a big deal out of it.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.159
Let's go

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.200
to Zhou Yanzhen's parents' house.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.659
They've returned from their business trip.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.960
This Zhou family is quite interesting.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.240
Zhou Yanzhen's grandfather is called Zhou Sanping,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.500
a businessman with substantial wealth.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.120
His father is Zhou Zhengguo,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.800
who took a different path and studied medicine.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.860
Now he's a renowned ophthalmologist in Dongzhou City.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.290
Ophthalmology.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.200
Eye doctor.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.360
His mother is Liang Jing,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.080
who grew up pampered

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.280
as a wealthy heiress.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.600
Now she's become a housewife

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.760
who occasionally accompanies Zhou Zhengguo on business trips.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.200
Three generations of the Zhou family

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.060
in three different professions.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.500
Each generation chose not to follow the path laid by the previous one.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.330
That's quite interesting.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.200
You've never cared about Xiao Chen.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.320
You're always harsh on him

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.520
and that's why his personality became so extreme.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.000
He just likes art.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.000
What right do you have to disapprove?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.920
Enough.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.240
Was I wrong to be strict with him?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.080
How dare you say that!

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.919
If you weren't spoiling him all day,

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.480
would he disobey me?

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.640
I spoil him?

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.760
Let me tell you.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.880
If Xiaochen really killed someone,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.240
you, as his father, are the one to blame.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.600
If you put half the effort you spend on your students

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.760
on your own son,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.570
he wouldn't be like this today.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.720
How can he compare to Zi'ang?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.240
If he were half as obedient as Zi'ang,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.970
I'd be thanking my lucky stars.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.640
Is he really your biological son?

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.200
Let go of me!

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.040
Alright, alright. Stop arguing, both of you.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.840
Sit down.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.240
Let's talk this through.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.240
We police are here to gather information.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.920
Why are you parents already

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.120
making final decisions about the case?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.130
Is this some kind of indirect confession?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.040
Officer.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.240
I know my son.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.360
He can be stubborn sometimes.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.480
But he couldn't possibly kill someone.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.800
He doesn't have the guts.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.640
Right. All he thinks about is art.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.840
He wouldn't kill anyone.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.880
Think carefully about

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.680
how long it's been since you've seen Zhou Yanchen.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800
Is he really as simple as you think?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.090
Now let's talk about Zhang Zi'ang.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.200
This Zhang Zi'ang

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.460
is Zhou Zhengguo's most prized student.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.320
In the early days, Zhou Zhengguo

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.880
would take him along

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.440
when researching major projects.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.840
Other classmates have reported that

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.200
their relationship is like father and son.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.000
Zhang Zi'ang should be studying abroad right now.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.170
Does anyone have any thoughts?

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.720
Based on the available information,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.800
from a criminal psychology perspective,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.000
Zhou Yanchen likely

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.680
resented Zhou Zhengguo's favoritism toward Zhang Zi'ang.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.680
Over time, he developed hatred toward Zhou Zhengguo.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.000
And because of Liang Jing's compliance and overindulgence,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.040
his temperament became unrestrained.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.600
This family dysfunction

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.560
would place Zhou Yanchen

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.220
under intense emotional stress for a long time.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.320
On one hand, he craves Zhou Zhengguo's attention,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.650
on the other hand, he wants to vent his anger through murder.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.920
I know what you're going to say.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.520
I'll say it again. No.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.640
Binzi, you speak.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.370
Captain Luo.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.760
Zhou Yanchen

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.480
has been going out frequently lately.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.040
These past few days,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.480
he's met with some art investors

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.440
and painters.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.960
But yesterday was unusual.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960
It was almost dark

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.040
when he left the exhibition hall.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.920
Also, he went home

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.180
and saw Zhou Zhengguo.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.490
When he came out, he looked very upset.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.200
What's today's date?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.440
The 20th. Why?

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.520
The time between each crime has been decreasing exponentially.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.600
He knows if the police investigate him,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600
he'll definitely accelerate his crimes

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.160
to complete his provocation.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.320
Today is the fifth day since the third case.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.880
He went home

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.840
and must have faced criticism

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.400
or even physical abuse from Zhou Zhengguo.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.000
He urgently needs to vent these emotions.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.040
He will definitely choose to kill someone else immediately.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.840
Cao Bin, stay on him.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.180
Roger that.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.360
Map.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:35.970
Give it to me.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.200
According to Bin's recent reports,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.600
Zhou Yanchen frequently appears here,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.840
in Jingxin District,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840
Youjia Building.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560
Time is running out.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.520
Two directions:

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.200
continue reviewing surveillance footage

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.760
and try to locate the first crime scene.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.440
Got it.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.040
Check the exhibition attendees

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.900
and identify potential victims.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.800
In half an hour,

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.530
we'll summarize our findings.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.360
Although the footage is blurry

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360
and we can't see faces clearly,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.080
we can still track the gait.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.600
When he walks,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.240
his feet are parallel to the ground,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.080
the inner side of his heel touches the ground first,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.410
then his foot pushes forward internally,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.920
people like this usually have knock knees,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.820
and their legs are more separated when walking.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.360
Look.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.820
There's significant swaying when walking.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.600
But Lin Wei is different.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.920
She lifts her feet quickly,

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.200
which makes her walk at a faster pace.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.760
Her steps are higher.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.320
See?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.240
That's very informative.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.400
Alright, I'll continue the investigation.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.120
I don't believe we can't find the problem.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.780
Keep going.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.920
How's it going?

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.400
In the guest list for the Drowning Exhibition,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.040
there are 25 women in total.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.880
Actually, we just need to focus on these three.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.520
Li Xiaoyu once anonymously shared on the forum

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.240
about being psychologically manipulated by her ex-boyfriend,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.120
suffering from depression,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.580
and her recovery process.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.560
This journey gained a lot of support from fans.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.360
And then there's Qi Meng.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.400
On social media,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.160
she posts about her mood every day.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.960
Actively fighting depression.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.240
As for Xie Yao,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.400
she posted on social media

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.000
about breaking up with her boyfriend.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.400
She's emotionally unstable

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.440
and lives alone.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.880
She did make some suicidal comments.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.640
But most importantly, all three of them

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.880
are 25 years old.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.440
Jue.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.320
Send me the locations

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.120
of the three potential victims.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.240
Xie Yao

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.080
34 Qianshui Road, Jingxin District.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.160
Li Xiaoyu lives in Jiahua Neighborhood,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.800
Building 6, Room 1104.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.560
Qi Meng

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.240
Fuhui Garden, Jingxin District,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.440
Building 3, Room 502.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.760
Fuhui Garden.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.800
Zhou Yanchen seems to be going out frequently these days,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.000
but he's actually scouting locations.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:09.560
Hello,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.290
Captain Luo.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.600
We lost him.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.400
Come to Fuhui Garden quickly.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.000
Copy that.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.600
Don't move.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.760
What's your name?

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.040
My name is Qi Meng.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.090
I made a mistake in my judgment.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.210
Captain Luo.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.800
Lin Wei and Zhang Wen both visited Huixin Shopping Center.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.960
But from the surveillance footage,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.560
I discovered a major problem.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.800
They both entered the mall that day and came out.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.960
But judging from their walking patterns,

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.760
the people who came out weren't them.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.840
I suspect the primary crime scene is in Huixin Shopping Center.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.440
So you're saying

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.640
Lin Wei and Zhang Wen

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.200
were already replaced with doubles

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.200
while they were at Huixin Shopping Center?

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200
It's possible.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.560
Huixin Shopping Center is in a busy area,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.320
surrounded by glass curtain walls.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.080
From the first floor to the top,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.840
there are no absolute blind spots.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.560
This place is crowded with many witnesses,

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.040
and Curly has already

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.359
thoroughly checked all surveillance footage.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.599
To control someone under these conditions

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.440
and kill two living people,

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.000
there's only one possibility:

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.800
the basement.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.760
Let's go.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.040
I'll turn over every stone

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.800
to find that bastard's

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.960
criminal evidence.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.080
Let's provoke Zhou Yanchen to commit a crime.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.740
How do you want to provoke him?

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.600
Hello.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.240
Guess where I am.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.280
