Wang Yuya.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.520
Either cut open the pig's carcass,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.490
I'll give you something to eat,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.520
and you'll survive.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.520
Or else,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.120
you'll starve to death.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.570
Stop being so dramatic,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.360
Zhou Yanchen.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.280
I'm a police officer.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.360
Even if I die here today,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.000
it would be a line of duty death.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.400
I would have a memorial service

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.720
and compensation for my family.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.240
Everyone would think it's a tragedy

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.400
and miss me.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.080
But you?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.600
Whether you survive miserably

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.680
or face justice,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800
people will only despise you.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.290
Your father would be the first.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.440
Aren't you going to explain yourself to me?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.500
You called me here,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.600
not just to be your audience, right?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.360
And your father...

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.400
Imagine if he saw you using his surgical knife

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.960
to gouge out Qin Mei's eyes.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.400
That scene

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.040
would be quite something, wouldn't it?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480
Xiaochen.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.160
Xiaochen.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.520
I've worked hard all these years

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.520
hoping you could have an easier path

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.600
and do better

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.880
with less struggle.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.320
The path your grandfather paved for you,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.520
why won't you take it?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.560
The things you can't do well,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.760
why force me to do them?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.760
Do you remember her?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.920
This was your masterpiece.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.560
I'm going to dig out her eyes

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.000
right in front of you.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.920
Let you experience what shattered hope feels like.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.000
Xiaochen.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.640
I was wrong.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.440
I won't force you anymore.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.120
Xiaochen.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.640
Don't you love painting?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.440
I'll send you abroad.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.480
We'll find the best school for your studies.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.940
I'll hire the best professors for you, okay?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.200
Oh right.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.240
Director Zhou.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.120
If you hadn't mentioned it,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.560
I would have almost forgotten.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.800
Do you remember your favorite student,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.079
Zhang Zi'ang, right?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.360
Let me tell you,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.600
he's already dead.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.680
Killed by my own hands.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.160
I used

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.920
this very surgical knife.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.400
Don't keep making the same mistakes.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.840
They are all innocent.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.000
You can't go on like this.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.920
What are you doing?

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.880
Where is your high and mighty attitude?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.810
Where is your arrogant authority?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.240
Why are you kneeling before me like a dog?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.880
I hate you for bringing me into this world.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.079
I hate what I've become.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.600
I hate that I can't go in there and cut you into pieces.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.480
So I will torture you ten times,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.720
a hundred times,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.560
a thousand times,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.440
ten thousand times more.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.040
Torture you until you die.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.720
Officer Chi.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.120
So tears are sweet after all.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.960
Do you even know how to kill?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.960
Take your scalpel,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.800
find her main artery,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.600
and stab it hard.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.210
Blood will splatter

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.200
and mix with your paint.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.960
That's real art.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.560
Don't you understand?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.680
Shut up!

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.520
Move again

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.560
and I'll kill him.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.760
Jue.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.160
I've checked the terrain.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.720
Go get a spotlight from the car.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.040
Shine it on him when the time is right.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.520
Cao Bin,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.720
we'll take him down together.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.640
We can't wait for Curly anymore.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.500
Let's move now.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.440
Wait for my signal.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.920
Okay,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.400
go.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.250
You took your father's life-saving knife

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.440
and stained it with innocent blood.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.440
You've finally shattered the patriarchy

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.640
that oppressed you for so many years.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.200
You must be feeling quite proud of yourself now.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200
I know why you killed those girls.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.480
Because you're jealous.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.970
You're jealous of them.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.240
Everyone came from the same darkness,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.120
but someone always pulled them into the sunlight.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.540
No one cared about you.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.560
Yes.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.040
They may be dead,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.050
but someone will always love them.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.020
What about you?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.000
Does anyone?

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.640
All you want is that sick attention.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.640
What will people call you?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.680
A great artist?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.120
No.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.880
They'll only say you're a psychopath,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.280
a twisted murderer.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.520
Trying to provoke me?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.280
It won't work.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.560
I don't fall for that.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.720
Do you remember what I told you?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.840
When you see this cage,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.040
does it remind you of anything?

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.640
This is your secret.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.080
I won't tell you.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.720
I'll let you live with this regret

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.560
as I torture you slowly.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.680
I'll torture you until you die.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.260
Let me tell you something.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.280
Secrets?

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.400
I'll find out myself.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.880
Kill me?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.980
You're not worthy.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.880
Is that so?

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.560
Try it then.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.200
Zhou Yanchen.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.700
Don't move!

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.540
Don't move!

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.260
Don't move!

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.320
Zhou Yanchen,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.960
you're under arrest.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.130
Give me an explanation.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.460
What explanation do you want?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.940
Why didn't you wait for us?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.000
I was in a hurry to save someone.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.080
Didn't I send you a message?

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.160
You only sent the message after you arrived here.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.040
Fortunately, today was just a close call.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.300
Stop playing the lone hero in the future.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.120
Wait.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080
How old is Qin Mei?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.760
As you suspected,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.890
twenty-five years old.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.280
Why only kill 25-year-old girls?

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.440
Not just girls.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.360
Zhang Zi'ang was also 25.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.360
Why only kill people who are 25?

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.400
You'll find out the answer.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.840
Bin.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.820
Actually, we're the same kind of people.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.290
Your skewers are ready.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.320
Thank you.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.290
You're welcome.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520
Officer Luo.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.120
I rarely get to come to Dongzhou on business trips.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.080
And I'm lucky enough to have you treat me to a meal.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.960
Just tell me.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.290
What do you want to know?

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.840
Chi Xia.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.440
Do you know her well?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.280
This person.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.920
She's my junior from school.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.000
I have to say.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.560
She's extremely talented.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.280
Five years ago.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.240
She provided assistance to the provincial department.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.120
In criminal psychology.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.320
And helped solve a major case.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.200
The school even commended her at that time.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.880
And now.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.810
She's still working in this field.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.360
Yes.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.920
Thanks for your help, Dao.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.640
No, no.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.700
Don't call me that.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.600
I'm kidding.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.640
About what I asked you to look into.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.900
Did you find anything?

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.040
I did.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.880
Luo Lingfei.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.640
She was also a member of your Major Crimes Unit at that time.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.400
Once when she was out investigating a case.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.660
She encountered a psychopathic killer.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.640
Let me tell you.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.570
The way she died.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.760
Was horrific.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.960
This case.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.280
Was handled by Luo Xun's mentor, Zheng Jinghuai.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.360
It was his last case.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.960
For some unknown reason at that time.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.680
The case took a long time to solve.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.240
All we know is that the killer.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.600
Was a psychopath who committed serial murders.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.600
We couldn't find any information about him.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.760
And later.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.960
Zheng Jinghuai was imprisoned.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.820
For allegedly falsifying evidence.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.160
You're not suited for the Major Crimes Unit.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
I'll go talk to Chief Chang right now

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.780
to get you transferred to another position.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.240
Our Major Crimes Unit

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.050
has a heavy workload

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.680
and frequent overtime.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680
Where do you live?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.320
Is it nearby?

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.000
If it's too far away,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.080
it could negatively affect your work.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.880
Let me know if you need anything.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.040
Sis.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.680
What are you thinking about?

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.400
Nothing.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.080
I only know his sister died in the line of duty 4 years ago.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.140
I didn't know that.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.860
Let me tell you something.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.400
Before she joined the criminal investigation team,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.800
she visited a death row inmate.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.080
Prosecutor Xu told me

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.560
this inmate was sentenced to immediate execution.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.960
A man who was about to die

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.760
after meeting with her

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.840
suddenly demanded to commit suicide.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.500
He didn't succeed, of course.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.320
But don't you think that's suspicious?

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.920
Why do you think this person's suicide attempt

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.640
has anything to do with Chi Xia?

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.570
Maybe he was just one of Chi Xia's research subjects.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.760
Listen to me.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.800
For people who study psychology like her,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.160
requesting to meet a death row inmate

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.400
for research purposes

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.240
is completely normal.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.960
I have work to do at the bureau.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.920
I need to go now.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.080
Take your time with your meal.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.760
You haven't eaten anything.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.440
Oh right,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.370
keep investigating Luo Xun for me.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.720
Chi Xia.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.040
I only lost to you in computer skills back then,

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.640
I didn't sell myself to you.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.330
It can't be done.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.440
That scar above your eyebrow

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.920
has healed pretty well, hasn't it,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.680
Shi Tianyi?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.240
I'll figure something out.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.840
What's wrong with you today?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.170
You're acting strange.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.160
No.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.960
It's about Chi Xia, isn't it?

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.840
It's a shame.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.370
That case with your sister.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.000
It was also a sick pervert who targeted women.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.640
Why is your master so...

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.500
That's enough.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.050
It's all in the past.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.880
Let's not talk about it anymore.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.980
My fault, my fault.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200
I ruined the mood.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.240
We're actually the same kind of people.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.680
We're actually the same kind of people.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.000
When you come back after graduation,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.130
Mom has something to discuss with you.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.210
Prepare yourself mentally first.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.000
We'll talk when you return.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.960
Mom,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.400
Mom,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.520
what exactly do you want to tell me?

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.360
Let me out.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.400
Lift it up.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.800
Raise it.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.560
Higher.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.640
Defend.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.720
Move along.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.640
Good.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.240
Hello.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.760
Miss.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.120
Hey there.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.080
That's not how you throw that punch.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.940
This punching bag is quite heavy.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.920
If you hit too hard,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.920
your form will suffer.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.160
And it's hard to control.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.220
We usually use it for combo training.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.480
Miss,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.640
I'm talking to you.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.360
Hello?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.960
Don't worry about damaging the bag.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.000
Just don't hurt yourself.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.860
I'd have to pay you compensation.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.080
Young lady,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.810
why aren't you listening to me?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.560
What's wrong?

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.280
Let's try.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.400
Get in the ring.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:19.800
I'll spar with you.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.400
Stop!

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.640
Boss.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:25.840
Coach Ding.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.370
Apologize to our customer.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.120
I'm sorry, miss.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.960
My attitude was inappropriate.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.880
It's fine.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.570
Go back to your work.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.040
Sorry if that scared you.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.840
My apologies.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.280
My name is Qu Bai.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.080
I'm in charge of this boxing gym.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.080
I think he's the one who got scared.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.880
Manager Qu.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.760
I hope you can better implement

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.760
the saying 'the customer is always right' in your gym.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.080
You look pale.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.410
Must be low blood sugar.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.810
Have a lychee candy.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.320
I specially asked someone to make these with real lychee juice.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.520
They're different from those made with artificial flavors.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.320
Try it.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.080
I wasn't lying.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.410
It's special, isn't it?

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.400
Delicious.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.160
Ade.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.160
Grab some lychee candies

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.280
for this customer.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.640
No need.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.100
Please don't be so polite.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.930
Consider it my apology for our earlier conflict.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.000
That's a rather cheap apology.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.980
Welcome to visit us often.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.320
The more you come,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.440
the better the gifts will be.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.220
I won't stand on ceremony.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.820
Let me make up for that handshake.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.599
Young Master.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.040
De.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.050
Do you remember her?

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.280
I do.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.920
Hard to talk to yet easy to please.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.839
Her personality hasn't changed.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.640
Indeed.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.760
Long time no see.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.040
Little Fox.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.400
Hello, sir.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.560
I believe Liang Ruqing's death

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.000
was a carefully planned hypnotic murder.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.200
Liang Ruqing stabbed himself multiple times.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.080
Twelve stabs.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.690
