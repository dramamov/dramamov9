00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yuya.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.250
Mr. Liang is coming. Sit properly.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.400
Hello, teacher.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.840
Mr. Liang.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.600
Mr. Liang.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.640
Mr. Liang.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:53.720
Mr. Liang.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.440
Mr. Liang.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.120
Hurry.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.610
Students, don't push forward.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.360
Step back. Step back.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.210
Stop gathering around.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.240
Move back. Stop looking.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.760
I don't know either.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840
Everyone step back.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.680
Move back.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.850
What are you looking at?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.920
This amount of blood.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.440
Before she fell from the building,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.700
her self-harm was already quite severe.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.020
My senior just examined the body.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.460
She landed head first,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.320
specifically on her forehead.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.490
Captain Luo.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.000
The surveillance footage is ready.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.760
How is it?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.820
It's a bit strange.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.120
You say this video is strange.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.520
What's strange about it?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.490
Her demeanor is off.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.000
When we were in school,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.520
we were also intimidated by our homeroom teacher's powerful presence.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.360
Normally,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.720
when a teacher stands at the podium,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.079
Either staring at students

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.400
or looking at textbooks.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.260
But look at her.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.520
Her chin slightly raised

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.250
as she stares into empty space.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.520
Her eyes vacant and hollow

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.960
for more than ten seconds.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.680
Even when she took the knife from the textbook,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.940
she never looked down.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.680
Her gaze maintained that unfocused stare the entire time.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.800
Her movements are too stiff,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200
like a machine.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.880
Also,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.100
from the moment she put down the knife and walked to the window,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.520
she seemed like she was following programmed instructions.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.520
Have you noticed

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.200
she stabbed herself so many times

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.460
yet there's not a hint of pain on her face?

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.120
Chi Xia.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.200
What's wrong?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.000
Chi Xia.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.400
Nothing.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.640
I just zoned out for a moment.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.760
Where were we?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.399
Jue was just saying Liang Ruqing stabbed herself multiple times.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.279
12 stabs.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.320
You counted?

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.720
Do you remember

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.920
when we were at the separate exhibitions,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.640
how many paintings Zhou Yanchen had of those people asking for help?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.720
This series of paintings has

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.100
12 pieces in total.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.000
Is there any special meaning behind them?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.060
It's not clear yet.

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.890
It could just be a coincidence.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.820
I think Liang Ruqing was hypnotized.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.159
Why is this getting more and more mysterious?

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.120
Hypnotized?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.130
Hypnosis isn't mysterious at all.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.720
It's a practice based on deep understanding

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.560
that uses conversation, guidance, and suggestion

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.760
to deliberately intervene in one's psychological state.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.920
It has substantial scientific evidence.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.400
It can weaken or eliminate a person's

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.159
independent judgment

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.120
and free will.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.200
Things like loss of physical control

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.320
and numbness to pain

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.600
are two typical effects of hypnosis.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.050
We still need evidence to prove hypnosis.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.360
Whatever the cause of Liang Ruqing's death,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.040
we need to find evidence.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.720
Curly, Cao Bin.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.520
You go interview some school teachers.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.720
Senior.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.340
Chi Xia.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.900
Let's go meet the students in this class.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.040
Everyone,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.100
quiet down please.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.320
Time is short and we have a lot to do.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.720
I'll get straight to the point.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.160
We're from the Criminal Investigation Division

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.159
of the Major Crimes Unit,

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.760
investigating your teacher's fall.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.920
You're all witnesses.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.320
Who wants to speak first?

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.640
You there.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.120
And you, student.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.320
I've checked the security footage.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320
You were all in the front row,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.880
so you must have seen better than others.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.720
Tell me.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.600
Officer,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.720
I'm their homeroom teacher, Xu Lan.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.320
The children just experienced a trauma.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.400
Could you question them later?

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400
That's fine, Ms. Xu.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.320
I'm sorry.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.360
Captain Luo,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.560
why don't you and Jue go help Juanmao and Cao Bin?

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.000
They have a lot of work.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.040
I can handle this.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.360
It's yours.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.000
All yours.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.520
Ms. Xu,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.800
could you please take us over there?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.280
Sure.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.080
Thank you.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.520
Turn left at the door.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.880
Thank you for your help.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.880
I'm sorry, Ms. Xu.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.480
Have something sweet first.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.440
It helps relieve anxiety.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.920
I didn't bring much with me this time,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.120
so boys, please let the girls have some.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.920
We don't need to recall the details of the incident.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.600
Let's just talk about what kind of person Teacher Liang was.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.200
I watched the security footage.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.600
When she entered the classroom,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.800
you all immediately went quiet.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.060
Were you afraid of her?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.200
Teacher Liang was indeed quite strict,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.400
and often scolded us.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.290
Several girls in our class have been scolded to tears by her.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.120
All the students were quite afraid of her.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.280
Well, I think

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.800
your feelings toward Teacher Liang weren't just fear.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.920
Because when she walked to the window,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.180
there was a boy who tried to pull her back.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.560
Who was that?

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.250
It's not your fault that you couldn't save Ms. Liang.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.840
Ms. Liang actually

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.160
wasn't as difficult to get along with as they said.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.720
My family is very poor,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.880
I almost had to drop out this year.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.800
Ms. Liang came to my home

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.880
and convinced my parents thoroughly.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.010
That's why I could come back to school.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.780
She really cared about me.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.720
You were the only one who rushed to save her.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.360
You were already very brave.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.920
We heard from other teachers

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.600
that you didn't get along with Ms. Liang.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.860
What exactly happened? Tell us about it.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.360
About Ms. Liang,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.280
her teaching skills were truly exceptional.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.920
But her temper...

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.280
Officers, you can ask around.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.159
In our school,

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:57.320
which young teacher hasn't been scolded by her?

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.720
She was always flaunting her seniority and giving attitude.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.810
Captain Luo.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.880
Not much useful information.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.010
We haven't made much progress either.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.320
This Liang Ruqing...

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.250
Had conflicts with many teachers,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.050
but they all reconciled later.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.880
Not enough motive.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.560
We haven't finished our interviews yet.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.160
Do you want to meet up with us?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.490
I want to check out Liang Ruqing's office.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.400
This is Mr. Liang's desk.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.600
Has this photo always been on her desk?

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.720
It should be newly changed this semester.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.280
I remember

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.880
it used to be a family photo of the three of them.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.960
Ruqing.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.040
Sir.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:08:59.720
Ruqing,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.320
calm down.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.920
Ruqing!

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.290
Don't be impulsive.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.080
What's your relationship to the deceased?

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.360
Ruqing, Ruqing!

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.320
What's wrong with you?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.200
Ruqing, you were fine when you left this morning.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.920
It's okay.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.020
That's enough.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.520
Ruqing.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.920
My condolences.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.320
Ruqing.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.580
My name is Sun Xiangbo.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.600
I'm Liang Ruqing's partner.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.320
Ruqing...

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.160
She was fine when she left this morning.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.120
How could she suddenly jump off a building?

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.420
How did you determine it was suicide?

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.080
I've seen the security footage.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.000
Ruqing jumped by herself.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.800
If it's not suicide, then what is it?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.000
Did someone say something to upset her?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.160
Or was she bullied at school?

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.320
The school must be held responsible.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.720
The school must take full responsibility.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.250
Alright, please calm down.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.850
We need to verify your identity first.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.440
Has the body been identified?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.440
I didn't allow it.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.100
He was too emotional earlier.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.800
Mr. Sun.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.220
It's like this.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.800
Regarding Liang Ruqing's falling case,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.640
we haven't reached a conclusion yet.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.360
But the police will further verify the facts.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.560
If there are any detailed findings,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.080
we'll definitely let you know.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.880
But now,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.660
please come with us to identify the body.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:37.850
Okay.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.370
This is his basic information.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.560
Jue.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.420
Let's go through this.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.980
Let me speak first.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.120
I believe the cause of Liang Ruqing's death

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.560
was a carefully planned hypnotic murder.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.480
Why?

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.400
Everyone has seen the surveillance footage.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.960
I think everyone can see

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.880
her behavior in the footage was very abnormal.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.820
According to our autopsy report,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.160
Liang Ruqing died from severe head trauma.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.520
But her limbs had no fractures,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.120
which is inconsistent with typical falling deaths.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.400
Because whether suicide or homicide,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.520
as long as the person is conscious,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.400
at the moment they hit the ground,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.720
they would instinctively use their limbs to brace against impact,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.120
resulting in fractures.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.760
Liang Ruqing didn't have any.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.000
What does this indicate?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.320
It shows Liang Ruqing was unconscious when she fell.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.160
Additionally, hypnosis

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.720
requires a hypnotist.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.800
Hypnosis requires long-term contact between the hypnotist and subject.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.920
Close contact.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.760
But our investigation revealed

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.960
Liang Ruqing's relationships with students

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.600
and colleagues were all quite ordinary,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.200
and she had no close friends.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.760
So who could have had close, prolonged contact with her?

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.490
Only her husband, Sun Xiangbo.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.800
According to feedback from some teachers at the school,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.080
their marriage

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.440
did have some issues.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.600
They argued frequently,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.160
but everyone thought highly of Sun Xiangbo.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.360
Looking at all this information,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.640
it's possible that Liang Ruqing

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.560
was the one with bigger issues in the marriage.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.480
A model husband in public,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.720
yet with widely known marital problems.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.610
Quite the devoted husband.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.600
Today he made sure everyone saw his

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.800
overwhelming grief.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.300
Don't you think he's overacting?

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.120
This guy is highly suspicious right now.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.080
Alright.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.840
Everyone go home and get some rest.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.640
Do more research.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.800
Don't just sit around.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.200
Tomorrow we'll visit Sun Xiangbo's place.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.120
Chi Xia.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.560
Are you feeling unwell?

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.820
Should I take you home?

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.720
No.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.920
Don't worry, Captain Luo.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.720
I won't delay our work progress.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.250
You need to take a break.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.000
You're not in good shape.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240
Although it feels good,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.370
getting injured would not be worth it.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.720
In my opinion,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.090
physical pain is ten thousand times better than mental suffering.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.600
But in my view,

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.600
physical pain

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.730
doesn't eliminate mental suffering.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.880
You might end up suffering twice as much instead.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.720
Ade.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.620
How about this.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.560
Don't just take it out on the punching bag alone.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.560
I'm free today, I can train with you.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.560
This will also reduce your chance of getting hurt.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.240
The gym owner himself is stepping in.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.560
You treat your members quite well.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.420
Alright, no need to be polite.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.040
Give me a moment.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.720
Okay.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.320
You win.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.520
Let's call it a day.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.640
How are you feeling? Any better?

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.320
Much better.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.720
If you need this kind of thing again,

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.000
just call me anytime.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.530
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.880
I've received another complaint letter.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.760
The student witness

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.200
didn't cooperate promptly with police to reconstruct the scene.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.600
It's because they said

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.600
some officers don't look like police

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.520
but like thugs.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.720
They were scared,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.780
do you understand?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.040
How many times have I told you?

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.440
Look at that messy hair of yours.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.360
I've told you to pay attention to your appearance

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.400
and your image.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.560
Do you know how

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.720
terrible this influence is?

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.720
My hairstyle has nothing to do with solving cases.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.250
You've got a hundred comebacks for everything I say, don't you?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.860
Do you want to keep fighting with yourself forever?

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.080
This is way too short.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.690
Listen to me. Short hair looks energetic.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.440
You're a police officer now.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.920
You need to present a good image to the public.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.880
It's all because of this injury.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.810
I missed your induction ceremony.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.640
Let's make up for it at home.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.200
Come on.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:53.840
Sis.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.400
Is your hand really okay for this?

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.860
Maybe we should forget it.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.000
Don't make a fuss about this little injury.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.930
Stand straight.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.040
Is this okay?

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.900
Yes, it's fine.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.250
You look very handsome.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.000
When I'm on the front lines in our unit,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.930
let me handle it.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.180
I won't let you get hurt again.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.800
Would a delicate flower choose to join the major crimes unit?

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.359
If you actually encounter a case,

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.000
your duty is to protect the safety of the people.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.240
Don't always worry about your big sister.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.760
That's Officer Luo for you.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.320
Your sense of duty is deeper than mine.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.560
I need to learn from you.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.320
At ease.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.800
Attention!

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.120
Sis.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.940
I'll listen to you.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.240
Young Master.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.900
It's not easy to fight when you're deliberately holding back.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.400
Her fighting skills are much sharper than before.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.660
She must join the game.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800
She has no choice.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.200
His place is too clean.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.960
It's so clean as if he knew we were coming

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.360
and tidied up specially.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.240
In the relationship between Liang Ruqing and Sun Xiangbo,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.760
there's a third person involved.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.080
Damn it. He just can't stand seeing me do well.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.160
She deserves to die.
