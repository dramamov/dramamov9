Wang Yunya

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.880
Based on the victim's condition,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.280
we can basically confirm

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.460
she was in a hypnotic state when she committed suicide.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.120
Although her consciousness was blurred,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.400
her focus was highly concentrated.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.320
Her suicide was performed with intense focus,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.120
unaffected by external forces.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.080
Furthermore, the autopsy shows

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.539
she hadn't taken any hallucinogenic drugs.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.220
This indicates the killer relied solely on hypnosis to commit the crime.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.680
How could the hypnotist ensure

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.160
the victim would definitely commit suicide?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.400
Mental anchoring. People under hypnosis

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.530
are highly responsive to the hypnotist's suggestions.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.160
If there's a significant level of trust

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.289
between the hypnotist and the victim,

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.080
During long-term hypnosis, a hypnotist can

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.120
plant mental anchors,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.180
which can guide the deceased to take specific actions.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.840
What was Liang Ruqing's mental anchor?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.280
That's difficult to determine right now.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.120
These past few days,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.160
I've been watching the surveillance footage of Liang Ruqing's suicide.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.400
These images keep replaying in my mind.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.480
I'm wondering if we were in a hypnotic state,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.960
could we possibly find some clues?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.560
Hypnosis cannot allow you to enter

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.680
the memory scenes of the person involved.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.280
Nor can it help you recreate the situation at that time.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.079
At most, it can only put you into a deep sleep.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.640
If you have too many images in your mind,

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.760
you might during the hypnosis process

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.960
mistakenly identify yourself as the person involved.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.160
Also, mental anchors cannot be planted in a short period.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.600
However, if you want to experience psychological suggestion

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
and find some inspiration from it,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.079
that's certainly possible.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.960
I just can't guarantee

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.160
that you'll definitely find any clues.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.079
I actually want to...

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.920
Let me do it.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.440
This kind of thing isn't appropriate

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.600
for a young girl like you.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.920
Alright, get ready,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.250
we'll start right away.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.040
Captain Luo, look at the spinning top.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120
Close your eyes.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.080
Relax.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.160
Imagine you're in the most familiar environment.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.760
You see someone you trust completely.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.420
You feel incredibly relaxed.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.600
Completely comfortable and at ease.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.440
Until I say 'Captain Luo, action,'

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.920
you will wake up.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:48.920
Luo Xun.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.520
Luo Xun.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.000
Mr. Ning wants to see you.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.640
Sis.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.800
Sis.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.840
Sis.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.200
Relax. When I wake you up,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.840
you'll call the person you trust the most.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.760
Luo Xun.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.480
Luo Xun.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.200
I'm your sister.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.560
Luo Xun.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.760
Luo Xun.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.159
Sis.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.400
Luo Xun.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.520
Luo Xun.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.159
Sis.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.680
Sis.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.000
Sis.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.160
Captain Luo, proceed.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.760
Your guard is too high.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.160
Plus you've always been skeptical about hypnosis.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.040
So even with enough trust,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.840
it's hard for you to be psychologically influenced.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.160
Let me try.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.200
I studied criminal psychology.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.560
I have some basic knowledge of hypnosis.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.560
Maybe we can build better trust.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.320
It's just hypnosis.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.140
Not suggesting suicide or anything.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.159
Just give it a try.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.800
Okay. If there's any problem,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.020
stop immediately.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.360
Come, Chi Xia.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.160
Let's look at this spinning top.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.090
Close your eyes.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.800
Relax and focus on my voice.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.000
Imagine you're entering a warm world.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.600
When you hear me say 'wake up'...

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.490
You'll wake up and drink water.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.800
Wake up.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.700
Is there any water?

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:13.960
It worked.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.200
What worked?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.280
Waking up to drink water

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.360
was the psychological suggestion I just gave you.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.160
But your nerves are too tense,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.360
and your self-awareness is too strong in the hypnotic state.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.280
So I had to wake you up early.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.100
We'll have to take it slow.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.400
Chi Xia.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.559
A man named Qu Bai was just looking for you.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.419
He says he has information about Sun Xiangbo for us.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.200
I've asked him to wait in the meeting room.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200
That was quick.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.680
Who did you find?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.160
Is he reliable?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.050
Don't you have any discipline?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.240
Go back. No need to see me off.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.160
You came all this way.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.690
Why shouldn't I see you off?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.280
Not many people get along with me.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.160
You're one of them.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.360
Thanks for this time.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.560
Don't mention it.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.800
I'll be going now.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.080
You can go. I won't take up any more of your time.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.320
Oh, and keep more of those candies in your store.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.120
I love them.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.040
Okay.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200
Drive carefully.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.560
Sure.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.240
Bye.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.720
What lead?

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.920
I had a friend investigate secretly.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.380
Sun Xiangbo's Hongtai Biological Company.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.440
Some supply orders and delivery receipts we didn't have access to.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.160
And he's been manipulating prices on contracts.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.290
This pattern looks like wash trading.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.200
The money only circulates domestically.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.800
While assets flow overseas.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.320
Good. Let's focus on investigating.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.160
The supply sources of Hongtai's partner companies.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.640
If we can find issues there,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.840
we'll establish Sun Xiangbo's motive.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.280
You said Chi Xia's case is related to hypnosis.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.900
Sir, it's just a speculation for now.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.520
The victim stabbed himself 12 times

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.880
and then fell to his death.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.200
Twelve.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.800
It feels so familiar.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.960
Sun Xiangbo's business partner

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.560
has confessed that they falsified contracts.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.320
Cao Bin and I also secretly investigated

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.450
Hongtai Biotech's source companies.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.800
They're all small workshops

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.000
with supply volumes far below their production scale.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.200
I asked Captain Luo to help me contact the provincial office

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.320
to verify Nie Qianyu's brother abroad.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.440
Indeed helped Sun Xiangbo transfer his assets.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.500
So that's how it is.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.200
It's been confirmed now.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.280
Sun Xiangbo's company definitely has financial issues.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.800
Although we can't yet prove he hypnotized and killed his wife,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.060
I believe arresting this man is definitely the right move.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.380
Let's confront him directly.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.200
Cao Bin, Curly,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.520
you two take some officers and find him.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.000
Got it.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.940
Go ahead. Meeting adjourned.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.200
Oh, right.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.200
I brought breakfast for you two.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.130
Eat it on the way.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.520
Without Brother Jue, who would treat us like humans?

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.800
Brother Jue.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.640
Alright, alright.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.840
Thanks, Brother Jue.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.600
Thank you.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.770
Let's go.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.800
Chi Xia.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.440
The case has progressed to this point

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.800
thanks to your invaluable contribution.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.600
Good work.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.440
Why so formal?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.880
But next time if something like this happens again,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.640
you need to discuss it with everyone.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.400
What if the person you find isn't trustworthy

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.960
and tips off Sun Xiangbo?

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.960
Don't let this happen again.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.180
Nobody's here.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.450
No one's around.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.840
Hello. We're police officers.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.840
We'd like to ask you some questions.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.360
Okay.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.570
Please go ahead.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.000
Since we have no feelings left,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.530
why won't you just let me go?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.600
Sun Xiangbo, do you have any conscience left?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.200
Ruqing.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.000
I've really changed,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.800
believe me.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800
We still have feelings for each other,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.520
even if there's no romantic love,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.720
we still have family bonds,

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.920
we still have Linlin.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.580
Linlin is still young,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.400
she needs a complete family.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.400
Stop pretending.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.360
Linlin doesn't need a father like you.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.020
I can raise her well by myself,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240
all I ask now is for you to set me free.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.330
I can't live like this for another day.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.840
Ruqing.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.720
I know,

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.880
I know you've been having trouble at work lately.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.000
That's why you're so emotionally unstable,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.800
and your family has been asking for money again.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.680
I can help.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.440
I'm not childish enough

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.320
to mix up work and personal life.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.040
My emotional breakdown is all because of you.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.200
Only because of you.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.620
Go find your mistress,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.280
I'll live freely with Linlin,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.340
isn't that better?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.600
Haven't you made any mistakes all these years?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.600
Your temper,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.560
your personality,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.360
do you know how suffocating you've made this home?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.730
Do you think Linlin even likes you as a mother?

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.620
She's just too sensible to say anything.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200
You always

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.000
bring the pain from your original family to everyone else.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.880
Your students,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.200
your colleagues can't stand you.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.720
Don't you understand?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.840
Don't you get it?

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.520
No one will catch you time after time.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.880
Ruqing.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.360
Ruqing.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.560
But I can,

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.400
I'm the one willing to always catch you.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.000
Ruqing.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.680
I was just confused for a moment.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.200
I know I was wrong.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.290
Can we not get divorced?

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.040
Please don't divorce me.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.320
You might as well have let me fall.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.040
And become a pile of mush.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.840
That guy got away.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.080
Captain Luo.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.700
Don't move.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.970
Why are you running?

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.720
I knew something was wrong.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.920
Where is Sun Xiangbo?

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.080
Tell me the truth.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.680
I don't know.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.340
I really don't know anything.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:30.860
I'm Chi Xia.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.520
That bastard Sun Xiangbo turned himself in.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.000
What?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.720
That's all.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.440
I follow the law in everything else.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.400
Let me remind you.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.960
While you were transferring marital assets during your marriage,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.720
Liang Ruqing discovered financial issues in the company.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.180
So you subjected her to long-term hypnosis.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.960
After she fell to her death,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.800
you put on a show of deep affection.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.240
But secretly, you sneakily disposed of her personal belongings.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.760
You misled the police with a suicide narrative.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.760
You attempted to cover up the truth.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.560
You destroyed the evidence she had gathered.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.240
No,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.320
what hypnosis?

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.440
What hypnosis are you talking about?

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.640
You planted an anchor in her mind,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.960
creating the illusion that she committed suicide.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.840
You've got it all wrong.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.520
Yes,

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.160
I did find her a therapist.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.800
But that was just to keep her calm.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.800
She only saw that therapist once.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.520
Besides, I'm not stupid.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.080
Money laundering only gets you a few years,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.810
but murder costs you your head.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.440
If I really killed someone,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.220
would I dare to turn myself in?

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.890
Feel free to investigate that therapist.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.500
He can prove my innocence.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.380
If that's the case,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.800
why did you mislead the police?

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.660
Liang Ruqing committed suicide.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.640
I was afraid her death

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.800
was really triggered by me.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.720
So I hoped you would close the case quickly

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.560
without digging up my money laundering activities.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.260
I originally planned to go abroad to lay low.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:02.760
But

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.839
I just couldn't leave Qianyu and the child behind.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.020
So you're saying you turned yourself in for their sake?

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.160
Officers,

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.220
I'm telling you the truth.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.760
Qianyu is about to give birth.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.040
I can't drag her down with me.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:18.970
If nothing else,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.240
for her and the child,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.599
I want to reform myself

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:23.730
and start a new life.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.740
What about her?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.400
Isn't she your child too?

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.000
How did you treat her?

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.120
Cold. Neglectful.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.960
Hypocritical and heartless to your first wife.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.560
You abandoned your wife and child, and now you're pretending to be a model husband?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.000
This is Liang Ruqing's autopsy report.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.480
Look.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.280
It's been so many days

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.720
and you haven't even asked once about it at the station.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.800
She was your wife for over 20 years.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:54.960
You're not heartbroken,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960
not even sad.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.530
You're using all your energy to escape the law

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.020
and transfer your assets.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.040
What kind of man are you?

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.240
But

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.400
I love Qianyu.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.200
Liang Ruqing is pitiful.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.040
But after all these years together,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.970
we only have resentment and disgust left between us.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.480
Linlin is a girl.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.840
She'll get married sooner or later.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.170
She can't inherit the business I've worked so hard to build.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.040
Officer, I've explained everything clearly.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.280
I believe

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.600
the law will give me justice.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.570
Sun Xiangbo.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Watch your words.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.840
Someone like you doesn't deserve to have a family.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.220
You don't deserve to be loved.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.400
You should be all alone,

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.690
living as a beast in human clothing for the rest of your life.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.320
I should undergo a targeted hypnosis session

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.520
to see if there's anything in my mind

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.650
that could provide more useful clues.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.680
So behind all this,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.320
there must be clues we haven't discovered yet.
