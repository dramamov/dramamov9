00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.520
You should eat less candy. It's bad for your teeth.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.120
Officer Chi.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.440
Sorry to bother you so late.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.000
Am I interrupting your overtime work?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.560
I'm not working overtime today.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.880
But I might as well be.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.039
Until I solve this case,

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.500
my mind is a complete mess even when I'm home.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.759
I'm just fulfilling my duty as a good citizen.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.800
Don't tell me

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.880
the Sun Xiangbo case is still troubling you, Officer Chi?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.280
I haven't had the chance to thank you yet.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.880
Although the case was a bit complicated,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.000
you've been a great help to us.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.360
If you really want to thank me,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.200
come practice boxing more often.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.280
It's rare to find someone with such compatible energy.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.320
Just chatting casually

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.449
makes me feel happy.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.840
That sounds great.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.680
I was going to prepare a medal for you,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.120
but now the department can save some money.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.760
Get some rest.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.240
See you another day.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.640
Okay.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.840
Goodbye.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.920
Goodbye.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.840
After all these years,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.240
you haven't changed a bit,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.360
still so adorable.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.000
Liang Ruqing is pitiful.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.040
But after all these years together,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.920
we only have resentment and disgust left between us.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.240
Linlin is a girl.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
She'll get married sooner or later.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.040
Sweetheart,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.760
today is your birthday.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.120
Daddy bought you

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.360
a nice present.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.600
A teddy bear.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.880
Put on the birthday hat.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.540
Thank you, Mom.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.520
Mom?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.280
I have a question for you.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.490
I'm not your biological child.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.960
Aren't you afraid I might suddenly leave you someday?

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.079
Silly child.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.320
Why are you saying these things?

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.880
We're a family together.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.120
Aren't we happy?

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.240
Even if in the future,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.079
for whatever reason,

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.360
we get separated,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.320
the part of you that we've loved

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.800
will take our place

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.720
and stay with you always.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.400
That's right.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.079
Today is your birthday.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.560
We should be happy.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.490
Dad will light the candles for you.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.280
And you,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.800
make a nice wish.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.920
Okay,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.360
let's make a wish.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.320
Sis!

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.600
Sis!

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.159
Luo Xun,

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.240
let me go!

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.920
Luo Xun!

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.920
Who?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.560
Who did this?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.040
Calm down.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.240
Tell me who did this.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.970
Take it easy.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.610
Your sister, she...

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.800
This is her phone.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.290
My condolences.

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.440
Sis!

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.200
Would a delicate flower choose to join the major crimes unit?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.760
What if you actually face a case?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.400
Your duty is to protect the safety of the people.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.460
Stop worrying about your big sister.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.440
Curly hair.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.040
Let's work out

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.840
and lose some weight.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.960
Stop exercising.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.440
We need to work.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.160
Not bad.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.159
Already in work mode so early.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.400
Looks like yesterday's gloom has completely disappeared.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.200
Good.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.560
Captain Luo.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.850
Help me think about something.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.840
Besides people close to Liang Ruqing and Sun Xiangbo,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.440
who else has a motive?

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.680
Hypnotic murder.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.960
Who could Liang Ruqing trust so much?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.960
What is the anchor?

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.610
Jing Hao, right.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.720
I almost forgot.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.440
I need to deliver documents to Director Chang.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.840
Good thing I set an alarm.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.600
Alarm...

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.880
What time are classes at Feiyang Technical School in the afternoon?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.640
Let me see.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.680
2 p.m.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.820
The anchor is the school bell.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.480
What?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.080
Psychological suggestion

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.640
is like when Curly hears the alarm

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.800
and knows it's time to deliver documents to Director Chang.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.240
It's the same with Liang Ruqing.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.720
When he heard the class bell, he jumped from the building.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.780
The class bell was his mental anchor.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.520
Teacher Liang usually

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.600
arrives at the classroom early.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.040
This time

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.480
doesn't seem any different.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.860
What about other aspects?

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.680
Xu Yang.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.600
Think carefully.

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:59.290
We suspect that Teacher Liang's death

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.160
is related to hypnosis.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.330
Your seat is closest to the podium.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.780
Did you notice anything unusual?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.960
Hypnosis?

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.000
Yes,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.880
hypnosis.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.140
Think carefully about

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.560
your teacher's condition at that time.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.210
Before she entered the classroom,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.640
did you see her?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.320
The last time I saw her

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.460
was the day before she jumped.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.850
She seemed completely normal.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.330
She even reminded me

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.640
not to forget my makeup assignment.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.040
Who knew that...

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.159
Teacher Liang rarely smiled,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.520
but these past few days I keep dreaming of her smiling face

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.159
and her yellow hair tie stained with blood.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.000
I wanted to save her,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
but I couldn't...

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.920
You're just a child.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.220
Don't blame yourself.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.040
Keep calm.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.640
Everything will be alright.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.400
This child is still in a vulnerable period.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.800
I'll contact the school later

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.560
and ask the counselor to pay more attention to her.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.360
We don't have many leads for now.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.880
I want to

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.840
start with the ringtone.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.360
I'll undergo a targeted hypnosis session.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.560
To see if there are

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.440
any other useful clues in my mind.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.160
Okay.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.760
Relax.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.520
Stay calm.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.160
Only this way,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.320
your consciousness can fully immerse

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.160
into the space constructed by your brain's memories.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.040
Focus your attention

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.880
completely on this voice.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.520
Good.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.360
Maintain this state.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.280
When I say,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.080
the sun has risen,

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.080
you will wake up.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.560
Hello, sir.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.760
Sir.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.040
Sir.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:31.880
Mr. Liang.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.680
Mr. Liang.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.680
Mr. Liang.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.680
Mr. Liang.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.980
Come down quickly!

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.720
Mr. Liang.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.920
Mr. Liang.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.120
Hello, sir.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.240
Mr. Liang.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.040
The sun has risen.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.120
Let me out.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.400
Accept your inner self.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.120
You're a born criminal.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.000
Go.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.320
Fulfill your mission.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.840
I'm not.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.160
I'm not.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.480
Chi Xia.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.720
I'm not.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.200
I'm not.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:45.760
Chi Xia.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.880
I'm not.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.170
What happened to me?

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.720
You fell into a deep coma

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.380
during the hypnosis session.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.560
We tried calling you

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.960
but you wouldn't wake up.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.280
Fortunately you're awake now.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.280
It's not serious.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.960
I'm sorry

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.520
for making you worry.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.880
I'm glad you're okay.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.960
So...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.600
Did you figure anything out?

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.520
So many things.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.760
I can barely remember it all.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.120
The bell.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Hello, teacher.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.560
The timing

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.410
must all be guided by Liang Ruqing's mental anchors.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.860
But before that, there should be another one

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.640
that

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.640
is the real trigger that caused Liang Ruqing to stab himself.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.900
But I couldn't find it.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.680
It's okay.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.480
You've already found many clues.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.220
How about this?

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.940
Let's go back to the crime scene again

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.880
and see if there are any

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.840
clues we've missed.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.170
We need to keep looking.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960
That's not right.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.040
What detail am I still missing?

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.560
Did you remember something?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.840
I remember now.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.480
What is it?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.800
Complicated family of origin,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.880
tense marriage,

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.120
poor relationships with colleagues.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.200
Students disliked her,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.720
and no close friends.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.530
Who would give her such an expensive gift?

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.160
'Admiring the virtue of a teacher's path,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.360
grateful for kind words during hardship.'

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.760
'After much reflection,

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.160
I regret my past actions.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.640
This humble gift expresses my gratitude,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.180
wishing you well on your journey ahead.'

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.720
This handwriting.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.440
Oh my!

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.320
That's a foul!

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.800
Wait,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.160
Xu Yang never played like this before.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.680
Exactly.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.540
When did he become so aggressive?

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.680
Ever since he got that new jersey,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.840
he's like a completely different person.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.560
Yeah.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.410
Captain Luo.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.520
Your analysis is correct.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.080
That pen is authentic.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.280
It's a commemorative edition,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.040
limited release,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.359
and quite expensive.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.920
Small stationery stores

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.050
don't even stock it.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.359
I just checked with

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.200
the brand supplier of this pen.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.560
According to them,

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.520
in the entire Dongzhou City,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.280
only the stationery store

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.839
at Dongzhou Garden Plaza sells it.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:18.640
Wait.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:19.680
What's wrong?

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.810
Is something wrong?

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.240
I'm thinking about something else.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.160
What is it?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.440
Given Xu Yang's financial situation,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.400
such an expensive pen

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.120
is not something he could afford.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.040
So behind this,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.440
there must be clues we haven't discovered yet.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.360
Let's not overthink it.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.020
Let's follow this lead first.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.720
Okay.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.000
Xu Xiaodao can't escape the charges of running an illegal gambling den.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.600
Nobody move!

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.130
Get down!

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.240
Stay where you are!

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.960
She always wears a mask in public.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.840
Almost no one has seen her face.
