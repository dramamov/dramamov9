Wang Yunya.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.850
You got what you wanted.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.360
Now you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.240
can finally relax completely.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.080
Look at your mother.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.840
Do you miss her?

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.320
Her death anniversary is coming soon.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.320
Take that step.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.680
Just like your mother did.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.880
Just one step.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.640
You'll see her soon.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.280
I knew about my dad's illegal card room.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.440
And that my mom was paying off his debts.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.800
I also knew

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.520
my father's public humiliation

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640
was the last straw for my mother.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.610
Otherwise, how do you think

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.900
Xu Xiaodao was caught so quickly?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.520
If Liang Ruqing hadn't used tutoring as an excuse

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.050
to interfere in our family,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.740
my mother, even if living miserably,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.500
wouldn't have chosen to jump.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.920
My mother and I wouldn't be separated by death.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.180
So she deserves to die.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.660
But you don't know that

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.520
the last text your mother sent before she died

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.880
was to Teacher Liang.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.200
Thanking her.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.640
This

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.060
is what we found in Liang Ruqing's phone.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.980
Your mother had attempted

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.800
suicide multiple times before.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.880
It was always Liang Ruqing who talked her out of it.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.010
Your tutoring fees -

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.640
Liang Ruqing never took a penny.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.000
Even some of the gambling debts your mother paid for your father

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.240
came from Liang Ruqing's financial support.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.240
Do you think such a person

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.970
would encourage your mother to jump to her death?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.360
Just now on the rooftop,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.220
I think you've already realized.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.200
Actually, you and Liang Ruqing are the same -

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.640
both implanted with the psychological anchor to commit suicide afterward.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.440
Xu Yang.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.740
You're a smart person.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.560
The person who manipulated you will never let you go.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.000
So there's only one path ahead of you now.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.160
Tell the police the truth.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.060
Help catch the person who dragged you into this.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.920
This way you can also atone for wrongfully killing Liang Ruqing.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.920
And I believe

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.920
your mother

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.760
would certainly want to see you do this.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.760
After my mother passed away,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.280
I felt like I lost my soul.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.600
I couldn't get out of my grief at all.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.440
My classmates saw my social media posts

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.240
and all urged me to get psychological counseling.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.720
You should really see a therapist.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.240
I hate the way they talk.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.200
They've never lost a mother.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.680
They can't possibly understand how I feel.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.160
Xu Yang.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.860
I don't have a mental illness.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.720
I just can't accept

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.880
the reality that my mother passed away.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.570
A few months ago.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280
I met this female doctor named Hu Li.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.040
What else do you know

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.720
about this female doctor?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.040
She always wore a mask

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.720
or large sunglasses.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.880
Even during hypnosis,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.840
when she took off her mask,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.700
I couldn't make out her true face.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.290
But she was sincere,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.850
understood me well,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.170
and could always read my thoughts.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.960
She said she's a psychiatrist

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.080
and asked me to help her with a therapy project.

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.960
Hu Li.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.040
She's the only attending physician in the psychiatric department.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.920
Go on.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.560
The important thing is

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.400
she doesn't lecture me like everyone else

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.920
telling me to move on with my life.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.380
Do you remember what your mother looks like?

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.920
Now close your eyes.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.720
I'll take you to find her.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.600
She misses you very much.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.800
She helps me see the memories

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.400
of daily life with my mother.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.060
That's why I trust her.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.530
And I'm grateful to her.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.840
Your mother was manipulated into committing suicide.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.440
Don't you want to avenge her?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.159
The learning atmosphere at the technical school is unstable.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.880
Dr. Hu told me to pretend to be studious

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.530
to attract Liang Ruqing's attention.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.930
Thank you, Miss.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.640
Xu Yang.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.560
I've been wanting to talk to you,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.620
but I was afraid it would make you sad.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.520
I'm glad to see you're moving on.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.640
It makes me happy.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.080
Miss,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.520
I'm actually fine.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.020
But your dark circles are getting worse lately.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.400
Are you not sleeping well?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.200
It's nothing.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.200
I've been having insomnia for quite some time now.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.040
You should go back now

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.080
and get some rest.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.960
After my mother passed away,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.360
I often had insomnia too.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.320
Oh, Miss,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.280
this doctor is really good.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.500
You might want to give it a try.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.560
Okay.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.600
Thank you.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.340
Goodbye, teacher.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.400
So,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.240
the doctor you recommended to Liang Ruqing

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.780
is this female doctor?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.200
How many times did she go?

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200
I don't know.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.520
Did you go with her?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.680
I went with her the first few times,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.140
but later she went by herself.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.240
What was the specific treatment process?

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.280
Hu Li didn't allow outsiders to be present.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.680
There were two occasions

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.700
when Liang Ruqing's condition actually improved.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.720
I asked her

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.920
about the revenge we planned,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.650
why things turned out this way.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.960
But she said everything was going according to plan.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.760
You claim you didn't know anything,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.720
so why did you give Liang Ruqing a pen?

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.380
Hu Li asked me to give it to him.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.600
She didn't tell me why.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.840
She just told me to wait patiently.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.740
But two days later,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.360
Liang Ruqing harmed himself and jumped off a building right in front of me.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.360
I don't know how she managed to do it.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.260
Let's talk about this jersey.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.680
This is Bulls player Korr's jersey.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.840
I did some research.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.240
Compared to other popular players,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.340
he has almost no fans in this country.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.000
And your classmate mentioned

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.040
that you used to wear

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.480
Kobe's number 24 jersey.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.420
So why did you change numbers?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.280
Hu Li told me to change it.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.040
She didn't tell me why.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.120
I'm curious too.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.080
What does this have to do with hypnosis?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.880
Xu Yang.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.920
You're too clever for your own good.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.530
At the moment Liang Ruqing was killed,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.000
you had already figured out

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
how to clear yourself of suspicion.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.160
Did you think

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.360
pretending to know about hypnotic murder would help you?

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.640
Then you can shift all the blame

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.760
onto a fictional person.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.800
I'm telling the truth.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.400
If what you're saying is true,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.159
your behavior

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.400
was the most crucial part in plotting against Liang Ruqing.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.640
How could that female doctor

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.440
possibly hide the most critical step from you,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.700
the hypnosis process?

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.559
What if something went wrong

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.000
and the plan failed?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.600
She said the less I knew, the better.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.440
Even if the police caught me,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.660
they couldn't convict me.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.680
Just like my mother

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.410
who was killed by Liang Ruqing.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.440
If the law can't find evidence to punish the perpetrators,

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.770
then we'll find our own way to punish them.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.120
Officer Chi.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.170
If your beloved family member died

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.360
and the law couldn't punish the killer,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.760
I think

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.050
you would seek revenge by other means too.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.490
Director Chang.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.080
Come in.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.880
Have a seat.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:26.920
Brother Jue.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.650
Let's begin.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.090
Director Chang.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.080
We've checked all surveillance footage

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.480
and found that this female doctor named Hu Li

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.160
has extremely strong counter-surveillance awareness.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.560
During her interactions with Xu Yang,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.090
she didn't leave any clues.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.240
Although none of us have been idle lately,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.640
we still

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.440
don't know what she looks like.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.370
Director Chang,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.120
there's also this number, 25.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.040
Zhou Yanzhen murdered

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.040
three girls who were all 25 years old,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.400
and Xu Yang wore the number 25 jersey.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.730
It's all quite strange.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.600
Obviously, there's a bigger conspiracy behind this Hu Li.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.800
I find it strange too.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.000
But based on what we know so far,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.640
we can't rule out coincidence,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.880
or the possibility that someone's being deliberately mysterious.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.040
So apart from the number 25,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.800
are there

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.840
any other suspicious

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.240
or related numbers?

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.100
Yes, there are.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.240
12.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.800
Zhou Yanchen, the drowning victim, had a total of 12 paintings.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.640
And Liang Ruqing stabbed herself 12 times.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.920
But I think this number 12,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.640
compared to 25,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.370
seems more like a coincidence.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.480
Twelve.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.440
Twenty-five.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.920
Interesting.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.640
It's fine.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.200
Well,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.980
during an investigation,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.120
having different perspectives

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.120
is better than being thick-headed.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.400
Besides,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.600
no general wins every battle.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.800
Hasn't Xu Yang, the mastermind, already confessed?

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.600
This shows we haven't suffered a complete defeat.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.400
From now on,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.520
it's not something we need to worry about.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.240
By the way,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.000
let's follow procedure and

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.740
transfer this case to the prosecutor's office.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.840
Xu Yang's mother has passed away,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.560
and his father is suspected of a crime.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.640
I've already spoken with the

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.080
juvenile prosecution department.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.120
They'll communicate with the school

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.600
to find a temporary guardian as soon as possible

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.000
to handle the paperwork.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.440
Good.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.360
Chief Chang,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.970
I have a suggestion.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:16.960
Cases like Xu Yang's,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.320
juvenile crimes aren't isolated incidents.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.560
Many children's minds

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.560
aren't fully developed.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.120
Their emotions

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.280
and ideas can easily be misguided.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.610
Do you think we could

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.160
contact the education department

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.480
to conduct some

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.340
mental health awareness activities for children?

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.440
That's an excellent suggestion,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.840
and this case

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.200
provides the perfect opportunity.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.930
I'll report it to my superiors.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.240
Also,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.040
everyone,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.160
catching foxes

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.420
is a long-term battle.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.320
So,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.440
we need to stay confident.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.760
Everyone's been working too hard lately.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.160
Go home and get some rest,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.280
recharge your batteries,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.880
we have bigger battles ahead.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.000
Alright.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.240
That concludes today's meeting.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.280
Everyone go rest.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.200
Cheer up.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:06.880
Alright.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.810
Director Chang.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.480
Cheer up.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.000
Luo Xun.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.680
You must stay focused.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.330
You're the team leader,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.660
set an example.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.400
Ms. Liang,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.450
this is your last therapy session.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.840
Now.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.360
Let's take a deep breath

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.560
and relax.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.960
Imagine

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.000
you are completely relaxed now.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.000
As you relax, you'll realize

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.920
you deserve this finest pen before you.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.560
You're the best teacher for first and second graders.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.000
The knowledge from books

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.440
has long been etched into your mind

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.760
and into your very bones.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.560
Now we bow our heads

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.940
and peel back your flesh and bone.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.920
Look at it.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.480
Can you hear it?

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.680
This is the most beautiful melody in your heart.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.360
It carries your pride.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.680
You're about to step onto

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.940
the stage that symbolizes the highest honor for teachers.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.120
Now we slowly

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.840
walk toward it.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.120
Step onto that platform.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.880
Take that step.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.760
Your soul is about to transcend.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.040
Don't kill me.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.720
Please.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.760
Don't kill me.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.040
Don't kill me.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.840
I beg you.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.720
Spare me.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.560
People like us

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.000
are born with sin.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.080
Come on,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.720
tell me

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.520
what's wrong.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.080
You were sweating profusely earlier.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.480
I noticed something was off during the meeting.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.280
Are you okay?

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.320
Luo,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.960
Do you think in my subconscious

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.200
I'm someone who desires to commit crimes?

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.060
What nonsense?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.480
Do you think I'm like Zhou Yanchen

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.680
or someone like Hu Li,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.080
someone who pursues evil?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.560
Are you sick with a fever

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.720
and talking crazy?

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.080
Why are you talking nonsense again?

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.720
To be honest,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.660
when you first joined the major crimes unit,

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.880
you always liked to think

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.200
from the suspects' perspective.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.800
You analyzed cases thoroughly and logically.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.010
And you spoke in such a cold manner.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.380
Most importantly,

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.080
you would stand in the criminals'

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.760
shoes and empathize with them.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.000
That kind of state,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.200
it was quite chilling.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.200
But

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.099
after spending time with you,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.359
anyone could see

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.880
you were just analyzing the cases objectively.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.680
What's wrong?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.000
Have you spent too much time

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.440
in a criminal's mindset and started doubting yourself?

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.300
Let me tell you,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.960
you're just under too much pressure lately

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.560
and not getting enough rest.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.400
It's nothing to worry about.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.050
Maybe you're right.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.440
Officer Chi

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.650
If your beloved family member died

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.840
and the law couldn't punish the killer.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.000
I think

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.250
you would seek revenge by other means too.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.500
It must have been painful.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.680
This victim

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.160
must have had many stories in their life.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.480
Take me to see Xiaorou.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.000
I'll kill you! Give me back my Xiaorou!

00:18:59.440 --> 00:18:59.970
