00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
Come, take notes.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.240
30.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.680
The deceased is female,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.520
approximately 30 years old,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.850
with time of death about three months ago.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.400
The back of the skull suffered a severe impact.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.760
I believe this was the fatal wound.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.770
The wound is 2 centimeters.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.840
Make a note of that.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.160
The bone density doesn't seem right.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.880
That's correct.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.010
Her body was treated with some kind of special chemical.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.610
Samples have been sent to the lab for testing.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.520
These residues in the bone crevices,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.640
as well as soil from the pit,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.600
have all been sampled

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.320
and sent for testing.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.720
We'll have results soon.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.560
Go to the meteorological bureau

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.220
and inquire about recent rainfall in this area.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.160
Captain Luo.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.250
I just spoke with the village head.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.480
Landslides frequently occur in this area.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.520
During rainy season,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.760
people aren't supposed to enter this area.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.440
But this area is known for bamboo fungi and wild mushrooms,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.360
which fetch a good price,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.920
so villagers often sneak in to gather them.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.600
Right.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.920
Those villagers who found the body

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.960
also mentioned

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.400
they were here three days ago

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.280
but didn't notice anything unusual.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.079
Captain Luo,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.520
you're right.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.920
There's a cemetery behind there,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.980
and a road at the foot of the mountain.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.600
I got the information,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.329
Captain Luo.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.760
The rainfall in this area

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.880
has indeed been low,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.740
much lower than previous years at this time.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.320
Based on the current scene conditions,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.240
does anyone have any thoughts?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.040
Speak up.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.720
The soil in this area is loose,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.600
making landslides quite common.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.200
And with villagers frequently gathering wild produce here,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.660
it's really not an ideal place to dump a body.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.720
I see two possibilities.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.760
First,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.440
the killer was unfamiliar with the terrain.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.240
Second,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.040
they were in a hurry,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.100
acting on impulse.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.810
My thinking is completely opposite to yours.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.400
The killer knows this area extremely well,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.600
and deliberately exposed the remains.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.730
What's your basis for that?

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.320
Look.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.839
The victim's body

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.279
was chemically treated

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.740
before being buried here.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.480
The information on this,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.800
Old Ning is still collecting it,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.880
but it should be accurate.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.640
Also,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.780
the burial depth is very shallow.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.000
Based on previous case experience,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.840
this doesn't match the psychology

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.640
of someone trying to hide a body.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.980
But right now we can only prove

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.600
that they dumped the body.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.320
Isn't there a cemetery over there?

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.760
The cemetery is close to the highway.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.800
But this dump site is actually farther away.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.240
Why would the killer go out of their way?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.440
It makes no sense.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.120
If I were the killer,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.120
I would definitely dump the body in the cemetery area.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.680
First, there are already many bodies there,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.610
easy to blend in.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.560
Second,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.200
I could just dig a hole

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.400
and stuff it into someone else's grave,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.160
and it would almost never be found.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.960
Exactly.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.440
That's the point.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.920
Considering all factors,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.240
the person who dumped the body chose

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.840
the most easily discoverable location and method.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.040
They wanted us to find it.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.300
Looking at it that way,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.610
this just got interesting.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.320
This is really fascinating.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.080
The victim had given birth before death.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.680
Time of death was approximately three months ago.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.240
The body was treated with hydrofluoric acid.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.120
The fatal wound matches our previous assessment.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.600
Located at the back of the skull.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.000
Caused by a blunt object.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.520
Most of the teeth in the oral cavity

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.240
were dislodged due to external force

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.240
impact.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.000
Multiple fractures throughout the body.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.800
Skull.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.800
Ribs.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.640
Radius.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.760
Femur.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.080
This is the detailed autopsy report.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.440
I suspect

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.120
the victim suffered violent abuse before death,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.480
but this is only what's evident from the bones.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.880
Due to the extended time since death

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.440
and chemical treatment of the body,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.280
muscles and other soft tissues have disappeared,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.840
so many surface injuries can't be detected.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.680
These remains.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.940
If nobody reported a missing person,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.880
then the likelihood of a crime by someone close to the victim increases.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.200
Combined with what you mentioned

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.320
about the violent abuse before death,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.180
could this be domestic violence?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.120
That's hard to determine.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.520
However,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.850
in my personal opinion,

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.120
domestic violence seems unlikely.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.600
Because domestic violence is typically

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.360
a prolonged pattern of behavior.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.680
Since it occurs over time,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.840
there would inevitably be signs of old injuries.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.570
But these remains show no such characteristics.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.040
This victim

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.770
must have had many stories in her life.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.840
The body can speak to us.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.720
Female,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.380
with childbirth history.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.800
According to the autopsy information,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.000
Dongzhou City doesn't have any matching

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.240
missing persons.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.200
I suggest we expand our search

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.260
to neighboring counties and cities.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.320
Everyone,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
the skull reconstruction is ready.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.880
Zhou Wanrou

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.120
I was just as shocked as you when I first saw it.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.450
This can't be possible.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.200
Although she was reported missing two months ago,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.360
the case was withdrawn that same day.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.360
I even went to the police station to check the records.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.090
She withdrew the case herself.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.080
Do you have her contact information?

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.760
Let's verify it again.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.600
Yes.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.480
Here.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.960
Hello.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.490
The number you've dialed has been suspended.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.680
Suspended.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.400
What about her family's number?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.200
Family.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.040
Here.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.360
Hello.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.240
The number you've dialed is powered off.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.970
Powered off.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.840
Xiao Xia.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.040
Is that skull reconstruction technology of yours reliable?

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.960
I feel like

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.080
it doesn't match her ID photo.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.000
Skull reconstruction is a new technology

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.360
that requires high scientific accuracy.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.720
It's definitely reliable.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.400
We can't contact Zhou Wanrou anyway,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.440
so as an investigative lead,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.300
it makes sense.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.720
Alright.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.640
Jue.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.280
You and Cao Bin follow your line of thinking

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.400
and expand the search scope.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.080
Curly.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.840
Head to the police station

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.960
and verify the case withdrawal information.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.600
Okay.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.690
You come with me.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.600
Last month's.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.840
Let's go.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.480
Our surveillance footage here

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.000
can only be kept for one month.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.320
As you just saw,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.080
this family hasn't returned at all.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.210
How much do you know about this family?

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.600
There are too many homeowners in this community.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.880
I only remember they have a son.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.840
I think

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.900
there was an issue.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.000
About six months ago,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.360
their young son was bullied by other kids.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.320
When his mother found out,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.040
she wouldn't let go of the other parents

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.480
and even brought the trouble here.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.040
Later, those parents didn't want to escalate the matter,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.440
so they apologized

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.480
and the issue was finally resolved.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.220
Juanmao found something.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.440
Zhou Wanrou has a son

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.170
named Pei Xi.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.080
He's 8 years old

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.080
and has autism.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.800
He's currently enrolled at Dongzhou Special Education Academy.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.320
Pei Xi took a leave of absence three months ago.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.450
Three months again.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.890
Any contact after that?

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.760
I'm sorry.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.320
Special education requires more effort than regular education.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.120
I

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.380
haven't been in contact with them at all.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.520
In your opinion,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.280
what kind of person is Pei Xi's mother?

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.200
Here at our school,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.730
we see all kinds of parents.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.880
Pei Xi's mother

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.040
is the most patient

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.320
and loving parent I've ever met.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.160
To be honest,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.360
many parents, when they learn their child has issues,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.360
as long as it's not a genetic defect,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.360
usually choose to have a second child.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.080
The national policy allows it too.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.760
But Peixi's mother had no choice.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.880
I've talked to her.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.120
She said that with Peixi's condition,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.440
she needs all of her love even more.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.700
Does she have a job?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.880
She used to be

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.760
an executive at a large

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.080
multinational company in China.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.400
But later because Peixi

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.640
was diagnosed with autism.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.960
She quit her job

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.880
to take care of her child full-time.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.720
Her career was going so well.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.520
Why didn't she just hire a nanny?

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.200
Obviously she felt a nanny wouldn't be attentive enough.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.640
Only a mother

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.640
would be willing to make such sacrifices for her child.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.200
I really admire her for that.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.720
Doesn't she have any other family members

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.780
who could help out?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.560
I'm not sure about that.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.140
But I heard from Peixi that

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.370
his grandmother needs long-term care in a nursing home.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.560
Juanmao has checked.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.960
Zhou Wanrou's only living direct relative

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.560
is her mother, Zheng Lanshu.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.640
She currently lives in Dongzhou Nursing Home.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.720
A housewife's social connections

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.250
are usually quite limited.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.860
What's wrong with you?

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.320
I'm fine.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.320
Mrs. Zheng's condition is quite serious.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.960
She can barely communicate normally.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.000
When you question her, please be careful

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.440
not to trigger any resistance from the patient.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.360
When was the last time

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.490
her daughter Zhou Wanrou visited her?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.040
I think it was in September,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.450
about three months ago.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.280
Haven't you tried

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.610
to contact Zhou Wanrou?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.720
We have,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.960
but couldn't reach her.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.440
It's strange, actually.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.680
The mother and daughter had a good relationship

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.200
with no apparent conflicts.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.880
But she suddenly stopped visiting.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.360
And since then,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.010
Mrs. Zheng's condition

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.130
has deteriorated significantly.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.360
Ma'am,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.840
when was the last time

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.640
your daughter came to visit you?

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.200
Every day.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.200
Xiarou,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.640
Mom has been waiting for you for a long time.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.320
Xiarou,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.160
wait.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.620
This is what Mom prepared for you.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.160
Eat up.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.610
Mom prepared it for you.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.040
Ma'am,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.560
has your son-in-law Pei Xinlu

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.840
visited you recently?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.800
Pei Xinlu.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.040
Pei Xinlu.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:39.920
Ma'am,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.000
you must pay for Xiaorou's life!

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.960
Nurse!

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.520
Pei Xinlu!

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.480
Nurse! Nurse!

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.880
You must pay for my Xiaorou's life!

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.800
Mrs. Zheng! Mrs. Zheng!

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.080
Please calm down.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.600
Mom!

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.360
Xiaorou!

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.360
Quick, hide!

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.360
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:54.760
Mom!

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.480
Xiaorou!

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.400
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.000
Quick, hide!

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.600
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.160
I'm fine.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.360
He's not Pei Xinlu.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.160
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.840
Look.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:03.800
Xiaorou!

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.130
Look.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.800
Let's sit down first.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.160
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.160
Look.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.360
You drew this,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.440
you were holding me,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.170
weren't you?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.680
Xiarou.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.840
Hide.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.800
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.240
Okay.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720
I'll hide.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.440
Thank you so much

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.240
officer.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.240
Mrs. Zheng has been experiencing these episodes

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.080
several times recently.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.360
For the sake of the patient's health

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.520
and your safety,

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.320
Perhaps

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.240
you could come back another day.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.760
Alright.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.360
Please take good care of Mrs. Zheng,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:40.760
okay?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.400
If you need anything,

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.520
contact the police anytime.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.360
Certainly.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.080
Are you okay?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.960
I'm fine.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.360
It was just quite sudden.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.040
What do you think about Zheng Lanshu's reaction?

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.080
The old lady's reaction was definitely not normal.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.560
She must have sensed something.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.920
But if we only go by this reaction,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.880
it can't be used as evidence that Zhou Wanrou was murdered.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.540
We need to do a DNA comparison.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.040
Pretty smart.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.820
Is this following proper procedure?

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.640
Special cases require special measures.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.480
Let's send it back for comparison first.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.000
Then after Zheng Lanshu is more emotionally stable,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.160
we'll do a formal extraction process.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.900
Where are we going now?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.680
To the station.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.040
To deliver the DNA sample.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.840
And then?

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.840
If the remains prove to be Zhou Wanrou's,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.360
then her husband Pei Xinlu

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.890
becomes the prime suspect.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.920
Their home would be the crime scene.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.240
After delivering the DNA sample,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.640
we'll get a search warrant

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.370
and look for clues at his house.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.920
Just what I was thinking.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.820
Take some photos here.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.080
I'll go over here.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.370
Where's the bag?

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.560
Need to photograph this carefully.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.680
Here.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.520
Wu.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.760
Come here, Wu.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.520
What do you think?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.240
It's too clean.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.960
It looks like only Pei Xinlu lives here.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.760
But that's clearly not the case.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.760
Zhou Wanrou and her child's

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.080
traces of life have been deliberately erased.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.280
I feel the same way.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.840
Although we don't know where this family went,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.040
Zhou Wanrou and her child

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.570
are likely in grave danger.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.960
Otherwise, someone wouldn't have

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.840
deliberately erased all traces of their existence.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.160
In previous cases,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.440
when a wife is harmed,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.560
the husband is usually the prime suspect.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.560
But there's a twist in this case.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.040
Someone reported them missing

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.280
and then withdrew the report.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.360
Looking at it this way,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.490
Pei Xinlu seems even more suspicious.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.400
Captain Luo,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.930
what are you looking at?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.800
It seems

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.960
Pei Xinlu left home in a hurry.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.960
He even put on mismatched socks.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.680
Let's go

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.800
back to the station.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.960
The DNA test results

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.360
for Zheng Lanshu and Zhou Wanrou are ready.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.640
Take me to see Wanrou.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.080
Mrs. Zheng,

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.210
let's go see Wanrou.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.120
See Wanrou.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:02.800
See Wanrou.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.320
Come.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.520
Slow down.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.640
Give me back Xiaorou.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.480
I'll kill you. Give me back Xiaorou.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.400
It's okay.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.460
Dad, don't kill me.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.440
Dad.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.560
This Zhou Wanrou is fake.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.840
Her appearance and body type

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.040
aren't they exactly like hers?

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.160
Actually, Pei Xi

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.140
fell to his death by accident.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.840
How could Pei Xinlu possibly kill his own son?

12 and 25.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.060
