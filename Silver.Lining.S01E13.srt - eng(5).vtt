00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Wang Yunya.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.640
Come on, tell me

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.970
what do you really want?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.540
I want Pei Xi to disappear.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.280
He shouldn't exist in this world.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.280
His autism is the best proof.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.760
You know what this is?

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.600
This is karma.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.800
You've gone to great lengths

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.000
to raise a son who can't even speak properly.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.280
Do you really expect him

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.360
to inherit your business when he grows up?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.920
I want you to do it today.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.560
How can you say such inhuman things?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.160
Peixi is my own son.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.520
What?

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.600
You can't bear it?

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.440
What about all the suffering I've endured over these years?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.770
How could you bear that?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.720
Dad.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.240
Xixi.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.120
Don't kill me.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.720
It's okay.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.520
Dad is here.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.080
Don't kill me.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.720
Pei Xinlu.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.080
This is what you and Zhou Wanrou owe me.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.800
It's the retribution you deserve.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.960
You can't escape.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.080
Don't move.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.160
Dad, don't kill me.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.200
Look at him.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.479
He's suffering too.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.720
Help him.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.200
I'll be good.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.440
Don't kill me.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.640
It's okay.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.120
Dad, don't kill me.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.180
Dad won't hurt you.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.000
Don't kill me.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.920
Xixi.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.479
Don't move.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.000
Dad.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.600
Xixi.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.960
Look at this.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.360
The kinship index between Zheng Lanshu and the bones matches.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.320
We can confirm

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.160
the deceased is Zhou Wanrou.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.360
The investigation at Zhou Wanrou's home is still ongoing.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.420
We can't determine yet if it's the primary crime scene.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.520
How's the investigation going?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.079
We checked Zhou Wanrou's home

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.440
for recent utility usage.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.900
For the past three months,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.000
consumption has been extremely low.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.040
Almost zero for the past two weeks.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.720
According to neighbors,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.880
for the past six months,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.320
the couple argued frequently.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.680
Their relationship seemed troubled.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.480
However,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.280
during these three months,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.640
they haven't heard any noise.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.840
This matches the estimated time of death.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.720
About the hydrofluoric acid situation,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.280
it's really difficult to trace.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.079
Because this substance

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.200
is a very common chemical product.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.960
Plus, with advanced information technology nowadays,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.620
even if the killer has no chemistry background,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.520
they could easily look it up online

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.050
and figure out how to use it.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.960
So now

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.400
we should focus

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.840
on Pei Xinlu.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.160
I've been checking surveillance footage all day.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.040
Just got back in time for your meeting.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.680
What's this about dropping the case?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.840
The victim isn't Zhou Wanrou.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.160
Do you have any new suspects?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.120
No, wait.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.120
The DNA comparison results are already in.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.380
It confirms the deceased is Zhou Wanrou.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.800
What?

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.700
Why are you backtracking now?

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.820
Dead for three months.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.720
How is that possible?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.680
The surveillance footage shows it was two months ago.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.360
Zhou Wanrong went to the police station to withdraw the case herself.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.600
That was definitely Zhou Wanrong.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.329
I've watched it several times.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.840
Thank you.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.480
Officer,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.160
hello.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.960
We're here to withdraw our case.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.760
We called about it this morning.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.960
You're Zhou Wanrong, right?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.600
Yes.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.960
Where is she?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.680
That's me.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.640
Is this you?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.370
Yes, it's me.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.200
Glasses.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.880
What's your mother's name?

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.760
Zheng Lanshu.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.440
[Signature: Ji]

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.560
When is your mother's date of birth?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.080
June 30, 1955.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.600
But my mom tells everyone it's May 11.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.680
Elderly people prefer using the lunar calendar.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.940
But her ID shows the solar calendar date.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.200
Xiao Li,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.260
make a copy of this.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.159
Follow this template

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.200
to write a case withdrawal application

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.159
and just sign it.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.159
Is the elderly person in poor health?

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.720
Yes,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.140
Alzheimer's disease.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.170
She's had it for many years,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.520
but it's gotten worse recently.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.400
When the elderly woman came to file a report this morning,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.800
I felt something was off.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.280
She could accurately state her daughter's

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.720
name and ID number,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.280
but couldn't remember her own name and address.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.760
I had to use Zhou Wanrou's household registration information

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.490
to identify the elderly woman.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.920
By the time I brought the DNA collection kit,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.120
she had already left.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.640
I could only call Zhou Wanrou's number directly.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.280
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.520
I've been using that phone number all along.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.400
So when I got the call,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.000
my wife and I rushed over immediately.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.600
Once we're done here,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.680
I need to hurry with my wife to find the old lady.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.080
Has the elderly woman returned home yet?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.880
No.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.440
We'll do our best to find her.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.480
If we can't find her,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.360
we'll have to trouble you officers again.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.620
You should hurry then.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.920
Okay.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.120
Go quickly to find her.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.580
Come back if you need help.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920
Thank you for your help.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.720
Next person.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.000
Right?

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.240
I wasn't wrong, was I?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.480
Look at the time again.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.610
Zhou Wanrou is clearly alive and well.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.760
My goodness.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.080
A woman who's been dead for three months

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.760
actually appeared in broad daylight

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.920
on the police station's security footage.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.450
This is like seeing a ghost.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.080
Where did we make a mistake in our investigation?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.880
We extracted the same DNA from Zhou Wanrou's home.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.480
The deceased is definitely Zhou Wanrou.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480
There's no mistake.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.400
I've carefully reviewed Zhou Wanrou's family registration information.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.160
She doesn't have a twin sister either.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.290
According to this registration form,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.480
the reason for withdrawing the missing person case

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.240
is because her mother, Zheng Lanshu, has Alzheimer's disease.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.480
Memory might be distorted

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.520
or confused.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.440
This means that

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.440
Zhou Wanrong was never actually missing.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.640
So where was she for these three months?

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.240
Obviously, reality contradicts their story.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.480
Could it be

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.460
this Zhou Wanrong is an impostor?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.760
But that can't be right.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.880
Her appearance and body type

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.080
are exactly the same.

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.890
And she has her ID card with her.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.840
Could Lao Ning have made a mistake with the autopsy?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.120
Go verify it again

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.440
and the others.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.300
Stop guessing,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.240
Curly.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.960
Take the video back as evidence.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.490
Once we find this Pei Xinlu,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.250
the truth will be revealed.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.280
Lu.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.080
I'm

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.880
Sandangzi.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.920
What is it?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.000
It's actually nothing important.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.930
It's just that these past few days,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.020
I haven't been sleeping well.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.960
Whenever I think about your son,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.440
I feel terrible inside.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.080
Poor Xixi,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.420
he didn't even have a proper funeral.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.860
What does this have to do with you?

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.040
How can it not?

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.660
We've been neighbors,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.840
living across from each other for all these years.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.240
That night when I was coming back from Mr. Wang's

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.040
I ran into you.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.520
I saw everything

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.200
that happened.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.159
They say even tigers don't eat their cubs,

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.840
but you're truly ruthless.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.900
You're more poisonous than arsenic.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.880
Let me tell you,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.440
stop spreading these damn lies.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.280
Brother.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.460
I've been eyeing an apartment downtown.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.210
Let's go check it out sometime.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.880
Where's my purse?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.320
Didn't you just buy one last week?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.560
I want another one.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.120
I'll buy it for you.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.080
Come here,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.880
give me a kiss.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.720
Who's there?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.600
Mr. Pei.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.440
It's Mr. Pei.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.300
What's he doing here on a weekend?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.800
You go ahead.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800
I'll check it out.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.000
Mr. Pei.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.050
You startled me.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Why come to the office on a Saturday?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.600
I'm here to work overtime.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.840
What are you-

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.600
Okay, okay.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.080
It's fine, you should go home now.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.880
Mr. Pei.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.240
Here,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.520
officers,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.780
have some water first.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.680
This Xinrou Company

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.920
was founded by Mr. Pei and his wife as partners.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.240
But Mr. Pei rarely comes to the office.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.760
He's always out seeking business.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.920
I haven't seen him for 2 weeks.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.600
You haven't seen him for 2 weeks

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.930
and you didn't think something was wrong?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.680
Officer,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.880
I'm just an employee.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.440
I just go where I'm needed.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.760
If the boss doesn't respond to messages,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.360
am I supposed to go to his house and demand

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.890
why he's not coming to work?

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.040
Where does Pei Xinlu usually go?

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.520
He told me

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.200
he sometimes goes back to his hometown.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.720
He also mentioned that the signal there isn't good.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.580
Maybe you could ask around there.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.440
Alright,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.600
that's all for today.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.040
Okay.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880
Let's go now.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.000
Who is she?

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.480
Ji Shiqing.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.040
What's her position?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.440
Just a regular employee.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.600
Why?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.000
Nothing.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.570
She's quite pretty.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.400
Captain Luo

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.120
Chi Xia

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.880
Don't you think there's something off about Ji Shiqing?

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.200
What issues do you see?

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.280
I think

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.480
Let me explain.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.080
Well...

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.280
I used that method you taught me before.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.000
When I was at the police station,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.040
I carefully studied

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.800
the fake Zhou Wanrou's walking posture.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.930
She walks like this,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.570
and Ji Shiqing walks exactly the same way.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.440
So what do you think,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.000
could it be that

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.920
Ji Shiqing was impersonating Zhou Wanrou?

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.960
Your effort is commendable,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.160
but I can't agree with your conclusion.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.000
Do you think they look alike?

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.040
Do they?

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.080
Not really.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.920
So I was at least half right,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.640
wasn't I?

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.240
Good effort,

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.280
but enough joking around.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.360
Officer Cao Bin sent me a message.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.000
He said they went to find Pei Xi's

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.400
extracurricular teacher

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.000
and her attending physician.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.040
Their conclusions were consistent:

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.480
she hasn't been seen for three months.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.200
Here's what I'm thinking.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.840
Qu Bai.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.040
You know him?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.120
Thanks for your help with this matter.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.360
That case with Sun Xiangbo's company,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.880
he assisted with the investigation.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.240
The person talking with Qu Bai

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.720
is a businessman with prior economic crimes.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.840
We helped arrest him.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.880
He's currently on probation.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.280
I'll head over first.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:16.810
Goodbye.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.050
Mr. Qu, you seem quite busy with business.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.680
Just making a living.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.880
To make money,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.160
you deal with all kinds of people,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:26.800
right?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.640
Making money isn't easy.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.000
Sometimes we have no choice.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.120
In this way, we're similar to you police officers.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.880
However,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.840
I do it for business,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.120
while you do it to solve cases.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.240
We both have to deal with all sorts of people.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.040
In that case,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.360
Mr. Qu, perhaps you should try to avoid dealing with police.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.240
That's not necessary.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.080
The police serve the people.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.060
We should maintain regular contact.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.680
Well, officers,

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.440
I apologize,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.600
I have a client meeting soon,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.520
so I must go now.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.000
If you need anything in the future,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.930
just let me know.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.640
As a concerned citizen,

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.770
it's my duty to help.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.440
Quite busy.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.040
Luo.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.760
Captain Luo.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.240
What about Zhang Chao and Ji Shiqing?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.100
Are we still investigating them?

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.000
Follow up on your own leads.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.940
Come with me to Pei Xinlu's house.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.520
What for?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.080
I haven't eaten yet.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.040
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.900
Keep a low profile at the company.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.680
We don't even know what's going on with Pei Xinlu yet.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.080
Now the police are here.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.200
If our little operation

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.480
gets discovered,

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.560
I don't need to spell out the consequences.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.440
I know.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.800
I'm not a child.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.770
From the looks of it,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.720
two weeks ago,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.080
he was planning to flee.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.800
That's nothing.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.640
I noticed three months ago

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.500
that something was off about him.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.800
But whatever happened to him,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.360
I just think the police are too slow.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.360
I hope they find him today.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.490
What do you mean?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.640
What else do you know?

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.120
Mom.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.800
Remember.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.360
I

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.480
will catch the killer.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.580
What are you doing?

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.960
I'm

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.080
driving.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.480
Was I talking in my sleep?

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.040
Yes.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.320
You said you must catch Pei Xinlu.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.740
Make a big achievement

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.050
so Chief Chang can personally pin a red flower on you.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.520
Is that really a thing?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.240
When I successfully caught Zhou Yanchen before,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.400
why didn't I get one?

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.400
This is an annual project,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.100
a special year-end bonus.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.800
Do you think

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.280
in this case,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.050
the killer will leave special numbers again?

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.600
12 and 25.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.640
I've been watching for them since the case began,

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.370
but they haven't appeared yet.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.800
However, if they do appear,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.930
it definitely won't be a coincidence.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.240
[Dong E-80090]

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.100
[Dong E-80090]

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.640
Hello, ma'am.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.000
Hello.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.680
We're from Dongzhou Police Department.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.680
We'd like to ask you some questions.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.000
Honey!

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.720
Stop eating.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.520
Come out here.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:07.880
Who is it?

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.360
Is it Xinlu coming home?

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.240
Hello, sir and ma'am.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.000
We're from Dongzhou Police Department.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.880
We'd like to talk to you

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.640
about Pei Xinlu.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.800
Oh, you're from the police?

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.600
You...

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.640
Is there something wrong with Xinlu?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.560
He's not in any trouble.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.600
It's mainly about some business matters.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.000
Do you know where he is?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.280
Isn't he always at his company?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.800
My son is very busy.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.600
He's only been home once in the past couple months.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.440
Sorry to bother you then.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.240
Take care.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.460
You think the elderly couple is fine?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.960
I don't think there's any issue for now.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.760
Their front door was left wide open without any precaution.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.520
When I was checking the laundry,

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.780
I didn't see any young person's clothes.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.480
When his mother heard we were police,

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.320
she wasn't panicked,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.280
just confused.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.600
His father's reaction was quite natural too.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.480
It means Pei Xinlu really isn't here.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.740
And the elderly couple

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.170
probably know nothing about all this.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.600
We're approaching our stop.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.330
The intelligence point at the village entrance.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.000
It's been a while since I've seen

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.200
that Pei boy.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.500
Young comrade.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.560
Did he get into debt?

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.880
I could tell he was shady from the start.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.120
How else could he make so much money?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.160
That's true.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.280
People who make big money in business

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.360
have dark hearts.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.800
Didn't Sandangzi mention the other day?

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.680
Pei Xinlu was cruel even

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.120
to his own son.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.120
Yes.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.960
You believe Sandangzi?

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.320
He's just a con man selling health products.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.520
Sir.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.880
Where does Sandangzi live?

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.080
In that old house behind the Pei family's place.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.520
Right.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.880
Who's there?

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.900
You're Sandangzi, right?

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.040
I'm from Dongzhou Police Department.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.770
Need to ask you some questions.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:03.800
Police.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.400
You seem familiar with the process.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:13.920
No,

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.640
officer,

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.119
I didn't do anything.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.520
Then why are you running?

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.680
Not talking, huh?

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.640
I just sold health supplements to old men in the village.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.520
Although they're not really effective.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.200
But...

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.440
But I have certification.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.960
It's a legitimate business.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.800
You're not finished.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.280
I'll pay compensation.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.960
See if there's anything valuable at home.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.840
Can you just confiscate that instead?

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.080
I heard from the villagers

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.320
that you saw Pei Xinlu kill his own son.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.120
Tell me in detail.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.000
What happened?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.640
About that...

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.280
Officer,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.760
I apologize.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.520
I was just

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.240
drunk and talking nonsense.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.720
That's not illegal, right?

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.920
Tell me the truth.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.440
Actually, Pei Xi

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.420
fell to his death by accident.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.290
How could Pei Xinlu possibly kill his own son?

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.800
It was Pei Xinlu who pushed Xixi down from upstairs.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.840
Then Pei Xi fell right onto that rebar frame.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.780
He was impaled instantly.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.800
Are you sure that woman is Zhou Wanrou?

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.480
What's wrong?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.240
What's the issue?

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.600
He couldn't even make eye contact with the police.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.800
He seemed a bit nervous.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.560
Anxious.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.360
Doesn't look at all like

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.560
a housewife who takes care of children.
