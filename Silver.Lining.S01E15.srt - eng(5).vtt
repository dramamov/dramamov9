Wang Yuya

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.440
Mrs. Zheng

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.880
Mrs. Zheng

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.840
It's windy here.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.099
Let's go back and rest.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.720
Don't interrupt me talking to my daughter.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.600
Mrs. Zheng

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.200
I know you miss your daughter,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.000
but it's windy here,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.200
and you might catch cold.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.680
How about this,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.560
let's go back first,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.620
and Ms. Zhou will be here in a few days.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.520
Don't interrupt me talking to my daughter.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.039
Mrs. Zheng

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.560
Xiarou

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.640
Xiaorou

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.880
Dr. Xie

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.440
Mrs. Zheng's condition has worsened again.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.800
Xiaorou

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.000
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.039
After working all night,

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.400
we finally have some progress.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.039
Curly

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.759
go ahead.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.800
First, we found a phone number

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.800
that Pei Xinlu contacted multiple times on his phone.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.200
But our investigation revealed

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.920
this phone number wasn't registered under anyone's name.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.759
The forensics department also indicated

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.240
that this phone number

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.800
stopped being used after Pei Xinlu went missing.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.920
We couldn't accurately track the IP address.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.760
So Cao Bin and I

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.160
made another visit to Pei Xinlu's company.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.410
Get to the point.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.760
Here's the key information.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.800
According to an employee at Xinrou Trading Company,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.480
about half a month ago,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.120
she saw Pei Xinlu at Mingzun Entertainment Club.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.920
This place.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.400
She saw Pei Xinlu with a woman

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.060
who looked very similar to Zhou Wanrou on a date.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.440
So Cao Bin and I went to the club

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.800
and checked the surveillance footage and registration records.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.440
Yes.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.850
And here's this,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.760
take a look.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.560
They really do look alike.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.560
Rather than saying Pei Xinlu was cheating,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.890
it seems that this Yu Jia

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.840
was Pei Xinlu's former lover.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.520
The two of them

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.600
dated for three years.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.920
They broke up ten years ago,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.640
and Yu Jia went abroad after that.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.720
But what's strange is

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.360
after Pei Xinlu broke up with Yu Jia,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.920
he immediately got together with Zhou Wanrou

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.650
and married her shortly after.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.680
Also,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.880
Pei Xinlu's company faced

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.480
a major financial crisis about six months ago.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.400
Right at that time,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.800
Yu Jia returned to China.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.120
And soon after,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.400
she rekindled her relationship with Pei Xinlu.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.360
This Yu Jia

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.600
is a key suspect.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.800
She could also be the next victim.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.440
Let's go

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.200
to her place.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.040
Captain Luo.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.200
No one's home.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.730
Let's withdraw.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.090
Yes, sir.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.360
Wait.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.600
That's

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.220
Pei Xinlu's house.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.320
Mrs. Zheng.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.649
Let's go over there.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.450
Where are you taking me?

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.520
Mrs. Zheng,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.040
be good.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.600
I don't want to go.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.440
I'm taking you to see Xiaorou.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.320
I don't want to see her.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.980
Don't you want to see Xiaorou?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.440
Xiaorou is waiting for you.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440
Your Xiaorou

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.700
is waiting for you.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.720
Xiaorou?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.280
Yes.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.680
See Xiaorou.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.040
See Xiaorou.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.040
See Xiaorou.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.840
Xiaorou,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.280
see Xiaorou.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.040
Yes.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.240
See Xiaorou.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.600
Master.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.400
Why does everyone like to come here?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.480
Mrs. Zheng too.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.200
She used to come

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.460
and sit here every day.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.320
Every day?

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.600
Since she changed rooms,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.800
she comes here daily.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.010
Wasn't she in this ward before?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.680
She was in Room 6 before.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.720
After her daughter Zhou Wanrou stopped visiting,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.680
she insisted on moving to Room 14.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.240
Do you know why

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.600
she insisted on Room 14?

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.680
She said

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.360
Room 14

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.820
is close to this place.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.040
Mrs. Zheng must have gone out for some fresh air.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.159
Her caregiver, Pan,

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.440
usually takes her out

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520
around this time,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.880
for about 2 hours each time.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.480
I see.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.720
They should be back soon.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.520
Often?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.640
With a caregiver accompanying her.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.960
It's convenient for the elderly to go out.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.320
We allow it here too.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840
About this caregiver Pan,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.500
how much do you know about her?

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.080
Her name is Pan Haili.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.400
She came to the nursing home about 3 months ago

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.000
and has been Mrs. Zheng's caregiver ever since.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.360
Although she hasn't been here long,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.560
in the entire nursing home,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.640
she's the person Mrs. Zheng trusts the most.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.920
She's particularly dependent on her.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.780
Except for her,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080
the old lady doesn't listen

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.360
to anyone else.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.000
Alright.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.240
Take us to Pan Haili's staff quarters.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.720
Sure.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.380
Please follow me, both of you.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.720
It's too clean.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.159
Unnaturally clean.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.200
Look.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.920
Found it.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.680
This is the employee register.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.010
It has Pan Haili's personal information.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.120
Take a look at this.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.640
It moved.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.560
Yu Jia withdrew money

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.640
from the ATM at Longyun Resort

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.080
just 2 hours ago.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.800
She's probably hiding here at Longyun Resort.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.640
Curly.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800
Call Captain Luo.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.200
Let's go.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.840
Curly.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760
Longyun Villa.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.800
Ms. Yu.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.280
The wooden cabin at the southernmost point of that hilltop.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:12.880
Over there, right?

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.480
Yes.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.000
Everyone,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.800
head to the southernmost cabin.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.760
Give me back Xiaorou!

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.240
Return Xiaorou to me!

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.200
Stop!

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.240
Stop it!

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.040
I'll kill you!

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.320
Give Xiaorou back!

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.600
Calm down!

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.100
I'll beat you to death!

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.000
Return my Xiaorou!

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.120
I really am.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.680
How's it going?

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.080
He's the chief examiner.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:04.720
Let me tell you.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.720
This old lady

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.080
is impossible to communicate with.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.000
Why don't you try?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:12.880
Alright.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.040
Is she emotionally stable?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.880
It's just hard to gauge her emotions.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.610
Captain Luo.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.640
I've discovered important information.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.440
Look.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.400
This Pan Haili

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.320
is fake.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.240
The identity she used to register is real.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.570
This person does exist.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.280
But she died

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.650
from illness a year ago.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.880
Look at this photo in the employee handbook.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.080
Don't they look alike?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.760
If you don't look carefully,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.960
most people wouldn't notice the difference.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.920
Although she doesn't look

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.920
as similar as Zhou Wanrou and Yu Jia,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.720
it's more than enough

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.880
to pass the nursing home's recruitment process.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.360
Then I immediately asked Cao Bin

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.880
to investigate the whereabouts

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.120
of this fake Pan Haili.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.920
Unfortunately,

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.720
we didn't find any information.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.160
What was this fake Pan Haili's purpose

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.760
in using a false identity to instigate murder?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.290
It's not just instigation.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.360
Do you really believe

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.840
that with Zheng Lanshu's physical abilities,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.920
she could have, all by herself,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.520
tortured Yu Jia like that?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.580
Severely injured,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.560
she's still in the hospital fighting for her life.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.040
And the injuries on her body

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.720
are almost identical to the torture

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.640
Zhou Wanrou suffered before her death.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.040
I also don't believe Zheng Lanshu could lure Pei Xinlu

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.280
to that abandoned building,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.360
torture him,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.440
and then kill him.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.560
So there must be

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.490
the fake Pan Haili's involvement.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.120
Everyone's here.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.600
Captain Luo,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.800
there's a situation.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.520
The videos of Zheng Lanshu assaulting Pei Xinlu

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.400
and Yu Jia

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.440
have been uploaded online

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.370
and already have quite a few views.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.240
What are you standing there for?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.840
Quickly contact cybersecurity to block it.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.680
Got it.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.400
Minimize the social impact.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.680
I understand.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.480
Thanks,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.120
thank you.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.480
Cybersecurity says

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.080
the videos have already been blocked.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.280
But they haven't identified who blocked them.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:44.920
Who was it?

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.240
They moved even faster than us.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.040
I don't know.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.100
Let's watch the two videos first.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.170
Give me back Xiarou!

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.650
Give me back Xiarou!

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.010
Give me back Xiarou!

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.440
I'll kill you!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.130
Give me back Xiarou!

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.400
25.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.000
Both videos are 25 seconds long.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.440
This number has appeared again.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.320
It really has.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.040
And have you noticed

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.360
that in these two videos

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.420
there's no sign of the fake Pan Haili?

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.160
This proves

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.960
someone is deliberately trying to frame Zheng Lanshu.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.560
Do you think the person who released these videos

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.090
could be the fake Pan Haili?

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.480
This logo

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.160
is a fox,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.720
right?

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.480
Fox...

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.400
Could the person behind this

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.560
be the one Xu Yang mentioned,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.360
Hu Li?

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.980
Almost certainly.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.100
But what does this number represent?

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.440
Young master.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.900
I'll wait for you outside.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.680
Qu Bai.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.400
Long time no see.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.760
Not bad.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.520
You've improved.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.260
Let's have a match.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.800
If you win,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.160
I'll give you the Jack disc.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.960
Sounds good.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.120
What mission did K give you

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.440
that makes you go to such lengths

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.800
and even deliberately provoke the police?

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.560
Should I remind you

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.420
that this isn't how our organization operates?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.340
You have no right to question my mission.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.000
Let me remind you as well.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.980
We are the same kind of people.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.640
We should be keeping each other warm in the darkness.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.010
You shouldn't empathize with the police.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.840
No matter how much you try to protect Chi Xia,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.640
she's still a police officer.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.080
Do you think when she learns the truth,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.080
she'll appreciate what you've done?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.360
Don't let momentary luck

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.320
cloud your judgment, Qu Bai.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.040
Is that so?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.520
Why do I feel

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.620
that you care about her more than I do?

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.160
You...

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.940
Showing off in front of an expert.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.570
How do you expect to beat me?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.160
Jack Disk

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.320
Come and get it yourself if you dare.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.640
Qu Bai

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.880
Don't go too far.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.050
With those pathetic skills

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.540
you still want to get your hands on the Jack Disk?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.140
You've messed with the wrong person.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.920
Be careful or you'll suffer the consequences.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.640
Qu Bai

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.240
Don't act so high and mighty here.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.680
We've both crawled through blood and mud.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.960
Why does she get all the love from her parents?

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.880
Why does she have that halo that puts me in her shadow?

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.400
I just want to know

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.200
what she thinks

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.120
about this case.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.050
Doesn't she want to find evidence?

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.360
The evidence and the killer are both with me.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.080
Qu Bai

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.000
As long as I'm around,

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.840
she'll never get what she wants.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.720
Old K really has raised a lunatic.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.760
Do you think your worthless evidence

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440
will be of any use?

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.720
Let me go!

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.440
Qu Bai.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.890
But your plan will eventually have flaws.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.520
The hospital just sent news.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.000
Yu Jia is not dead.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.360
She's now under police protection.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.480
Once Yu Jia wakes up,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.240
all your so-called evidence

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.480
will become meaningless jokes.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.560
I suggest you think about how to fix this mess.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.880
Stay away from Chi Xia.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.000
Qu Bai.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.320
Qu Bai.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.480
The recent homicide cases caused by Hu Li.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.010
Although the killer was caught by the police,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.400
she wasn't exposed.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.080
And she didn't receive any punishment from Old K.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.320
That's very unusual.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.520
I'm afraid these cases

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.410
are related to Chi Xia's memories.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.280
If you hadn't taken advantage of the situation,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.000
I wouldn't have lost my child.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.080
So Pei Xi is here to pay with her life.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.960
You mean

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.020
this person is a scapegoat prepared by the Fox long ago?

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.040
You've actually found her already.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.960
Then you'll never find the Fox.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.330
What do you mean?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.410
