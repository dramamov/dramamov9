Wang Yuya

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.480
Zheng Lanshu is under house arrest now

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.810
and her condition seems to have worsened.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.440
She doesn't remember anything now.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.400
I doubt we can get a confession.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.000
Let me try.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.800
Mrs. Zheng.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.640
Mom.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.320
Young officer,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.760
did I kill someone?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.160
You...

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.440
Remember now?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.160
I'm getting old

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.740
and have no strength left.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.360
I wanted to avenge my daughter

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.920
so I needed someone to help.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.680
Come.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.050
Let's sit here and talk.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.960
What do you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.800
remember?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.880
I remember things

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.040
occasionally.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.280
I can only remember a few hours.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.009
When I woke up this morning,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.680
I saw someone watching over me.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.930
Then I understood everything.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.880
Pan told me.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.680
Xixi was murdered by Pei Xinlu.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.600
Xiaorou was also killed by her lover.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.920
Xixi was stabbed to death with a steel rod.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.760
Xiaorou was beaten to death.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.720
Those animals!

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.360
I don't know why Pan wanted to help me.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.440
But I'm grateful to her.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.720
Without her,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.280
I would have no way

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.520
to get justice for my children.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680
Her father

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.640
died of illness before she was born.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.200
I carried her for ten months

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360
and raised her all by myself. She was my precious baby.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.560
How dare Pei Xinlu!

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.640
How dare he!

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.360
I killed Pei Xinlu.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.680
I killed Yu Jia too.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.160
I avenged Xixi and Xiaorou.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.320
Child.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.560
You must have a mother.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.600
You must understand

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.079
why I did this.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.400
Why are you crying?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.079
Let mommy wipe your tears.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.020
I'm talking to you.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.560
Cute little fox.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.800
Little fox.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.800
Have you ever thought about leaving this place?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.600
Leave?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.360
Yes.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.160
Go to a place where sunlight can reach.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.800
Ade.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.720
Give Chi Xiao a message.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.920
Tell her

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.080
I won't interfere with her mission.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.120
But I absolutely will not allow

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.720
her to do anything that harms Chi Xia.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.000
Understood.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.160
Hello.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.220
Package delivery.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.640
Hello.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.770
Package for Luo Xun.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.320
Thank you.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.250
You're welcome.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.160
Occupation:

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.960
Tu Guo'an.

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.560
Save me.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.840
Save me.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.320
Little fox.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.040
You must survive.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.920
Hurry up.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.600
Chi Xia.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.480
Wake up.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.200
Chi Xia.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.810
You had a nightmare.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.640
Get up now.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.600
Yu Jia is awake.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.560
I'll wait for you downstairs.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.690
Get yourself ready.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.890
Are you still not feeling well?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.120
Do you want to sleep a bit more?

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.840
No.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.880
How did you know my front door password?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.320
Last time I

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.240
accidentally saw your

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.680
phone unlock password.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.820
I called you this morning but you didn't answer,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.799
so I came to your place to find you.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.760
I nearly broke your door knocking,

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.020
but you didn't open it.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.240
Then I thought,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.480
what if you used the same password?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480
So I tried it.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.159
And it worked.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.240
You're so clever.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.800
What are you thinking about?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.120
Are you worried that Yu Jia won't confess?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.400
Right now we can only connect

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.080
the known clues together.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.770
We can't yet confirm that Yu Jia is the killer.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.040
But we can't let her know

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.000
that we don't know.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.660
Otherwise she'll definitely deny everything.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.160
Why don't you just say it directly?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.620
Isn't this direct enough?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.520
It means she's a patient now.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.000
She's experienced tension,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.680
fear, and physical suffering.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.800
If we put some

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.960
psychological pressure on her...

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.940
Chi Xia, I've noticed you're becoming more and more...

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.040
Officer,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.840
please help me.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.560
Now that you're awake, please tell us

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.220
how you murdered Zhou Wanrou.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.880
My head hurts so much right now.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880
Stop pretending.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.560
All your vital signs are normal now.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.280
They gave up on you.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.800
But the doctors didn't.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.040
So I suggest you think carefully.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.200
If you continue to deny everything,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.840
in the end, the only one facing legal punishment

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.920
will be you alone.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.880
I don't understand what you're talking about.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.130
I don't understand.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.290
Let me break it down for you.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.520
Ten years ago,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.450
you broke up with Pei Xinlu.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.340
Then he immediately got married,

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.240
had a perfect family,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.640
and a successful career.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.040
So you were jealous.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.940
You've hated him for 10 years.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.760
You got angrier and angrier,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.480
so you returned to Dongzhou.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.040
You were determined to destroy their marriage.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.280
You couldn't stand that they had a child together.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.400
So you took advantage of Pei Xi

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.720
having autism.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.780
You manipulated Pei Xinlu into killing his own son.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.720
You even fantasized about rekindling your relationship with him.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.720
Then giving him a healthy child,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.720
isn't that right?

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.560
No.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.760
He doesn't deserve it.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.240
Pei Xi died in an accident.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.640
You think it's heaven's justice,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.040
giving you what you wanted.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.840
But you're still not satisfied.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.040
You believe the root of your tragic life

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.160
is Zhou Wanrou.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.360
Am I right?

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.640
I told you I don't understand.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720
If it weren't for her,

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.800
you could have stayed with Pei Xinlu,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.560
and avoided these ten painful years.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.560
So you interfered in someone else's marriage.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.760
I didn't interfere.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.240
Zhou Wanrou was the mistress.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.160
So you killed her.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.280
I didn't mean to kill her.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.680
I only hurt her.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.480
Back then, Pei Xinlu

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.010
wanted to expand the company's new business.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.280
Behind your back,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.610
he got together with Manager Zhou Wanrou.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.120
You couldn't bear the betrayal.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.560
That's why you hated her so much

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.480
that you wanted to get revenge on Zhou Wanrou.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.520
That's not all.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.760
Ten years ago.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.280
He and Zhou Wanrou killed my child.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.400
I can never be a mother again.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.560
What else?

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.810
Just say it here.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.050
When did you get together with her?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.320
Say something.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.970
Did you break up with me because of her?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.600
Can she give you resources?

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.960
Things I couldn't give you.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.920
Calm down.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.040
Haven't I given you enough?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.880
Just calm down.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.560
Let me tell you.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.800
She's gentler than you.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.600
More sensible than you.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.360
She's better than you in every way.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.800
I can be gentle too.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.200
I don't need that.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.160
I can change.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.200
I don't want you to change.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.600
You irritate me now.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.440
Please disappear from my sight.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.160
Will you?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.680
We're completely over.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.160
I don't want to break up.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.120
I won't break up.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.040
Let go of me.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.200
Let go.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.240
Let me go.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.480
I won't let go.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.400
Let go!

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.880
What are you looking at?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.810
Get back to work.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.120
Show some self-respect.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.600
Stop bothering me.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.380
What you didn't expect was

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.420
they eventually got married.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.600
And then

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.520
Peixi was born.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.560
So you manipulated Pei Xinlu into killing Peixi.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.640
You wanted to take revenge on Zhou Wanrou,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.120
to make her feel the pain of losing a child.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.360
I'm right, aren't I?

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.640
That's right.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.480
I witnessed Pei Xi's accidental fall.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.280
Don't kill me.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.520
Dad.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.320
Xixi.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.280
But I still told Zhou Wanrou

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.280
that I ordered Pei Xinlu to push her son down.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.960
Because only this way,

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.560
could she truly understand

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.240
the pain of losing a child.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.720
Only then could she feel what I felt.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.260
Not enough, right?

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.610
Just Pei Xi alone isn't enough.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.240
The person you truly resent is Zhou Wanrou.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.440
If you don't kill her,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.850
you definitely won't stop.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.600
Killing Pei Xi

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.960
has made you addicted to murder, hasn't it?

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.560
Then you quickly killed Zhou Wanrou.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.600
She came looking for me herself.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.000
What do you mean by that text message you sent me?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.530
What do you mean Pei Xi was killed by Pei Xinlu?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.280
What?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.520
You don't believe me?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.680
Then let me tell you something else.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.920
I told Pei Xinlu to push Pei Xi down.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.360
I saw him push Pei Xi with my own eyes.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.760
I watched your son get impaled by steel bars.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.560
Impossible.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.920
Pei Xi was Pei Xinlu's biological son.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.680
How could he possibly kill his own son?

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.360
He always listens to me.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.620
The way he betrayed me to please you back then

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.800
is exactly how he's come back to me now.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.680
If you hadn't taken advantage of the situation,

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.400
I wouldn't have lost my child.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.640
So Pei Xi is here to pay with his life.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.040
That's nonsense.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.960
When I got together with Pei Xinlu,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.360
I had no idea you two were already together.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.850
What did Pei Xi do wrong?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.680
He was such an innocent, pure child.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.120
I wished I could

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.160
stay by his side 24 hours a day.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.200
I was just hoping he would gradually recover

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.730
to be like normal children.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.660
I was careless just that one time,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.440
just once,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.240
and you got him killed.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.840
So you're free now.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.600
You should be thanking me.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.600
That stupid son of yours,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.640
what's the point of keeping him anyway?

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.680
Shut up!

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.530
I want you to pay with your life.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.620
Zhou Wanrou was very emotional at that time.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.680
I was afraid she would lose control and hurt me.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.560
I was filled with hatred at that moment,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.000
so I beat her up.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.280
But I panicked afterwards,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.120
so I called Fox.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.600
Her subordinate killed the person.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.200
Not me.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.880
Fox?

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.480
Which fox?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.920
The codename is Fox,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.240
the animal fox.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.860
Finally getting to the point.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.520
Tell me about it.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.600
How did you meet?

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.320
A year ago.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.560
I met Fox on a forum

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.640
where people share emotional experiences.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.240
We talked a lot.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.160
She made me feel

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.880
a strong sense of trust.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.000
So I told her

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.120
my story in detail.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.020
She said she could help me.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.080
She could make Pei Xinlu

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.000
willingly kill Pei Xi.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.680
She also said

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.940
she could help me get revenge on Zhou Wanrou.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.000
The condition is

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.130
to hand over Zhou Wanrou and Pei Xi to her after it's done.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.700
As for what she plans to do,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.060
she didn't say,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.410
and I didn't ask.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.200
You're willing to trust that fox,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.120
who supposedly has the ability to make Pei Xinlu

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.920
willingly help you get revenge.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.480
It's not just because of his guilt

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.940
for abandoning and betraying you back then.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.200
Six months ago,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.040
his company faced a financial crisis.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.400
You happened to return to the country

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.760
and helped him resolve those financial difficulties.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.920
So naturally,

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.520
you came back into his sight.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.560
Because he needed your help.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.280
So you shamelessly took control over him.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.240
If I'm not mistaken,

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.780
Pei Xinlu's company's financial crisis

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.200
was also orchestrated by this fox you mentioned, right?

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.079
No matter how capable she is,

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.119
she'll still treat you as a disposable pawn.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.050
Even when you ran to Longyun Manor,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.810
she still didn't let you go.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.839
Tell me,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.740
how did she find you there?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.680
A week ago.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.620
Pei Xinlu suddenly disappeared.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.800
I was afraid he was taken away for questioning

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.680
because of Zhou Wanrou's death case.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.280
So I changed my phone number.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.000
But I was still worried.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.120
Longyun Villa

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.880
doesn't require real-name registration.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.520
So I hid there.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.410
I hesitated for a whole day.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.530
I just sent the location to Fox.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.810
Who knew I'd almost get myself killed.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.540
Where is Zheng Lanshu?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.120
Who took her there?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.200
Is it this person?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.520
It's her.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.290
She's also the one who killed Zhou Wanrou.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.520
I can't believe you've already found her.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.360
But you'll never find Fox.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.370
What do you mean?

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.520
Are you saying

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.250
this person is a scapegoat Fox prepared long ago?

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.900
I should have realized it sooner.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.280
At first, for some unknown reason,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.000
Fox approached me.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.170
Said she could help me get revenge.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.880
The exchange was that

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.640
I had to hand Pei Xi over to her.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.680
But you didn't follow through,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.200
so she abandoned you.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.000
In the end, Zhou Wanrou died.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.000
Zhou Wanrou's death

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.880
served the same purpose as Pei Xi would have.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.880
Eventually she changed partners

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.800
to Zheng Lanshu.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.560
She promised to help Zheng Lanshu get revenge

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.920
using the same method.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.320
She killed the person responsible for

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.200
Pei Xi and Zhou Wanrou's deaths - Pei Xinlu.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.040
And me too.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.840
Finally, she planned to frame me

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.300
for Zhou Wanrou's murder.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.780
A perfect crime with no witness left.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.360
The number twenty-five

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.520
has appeared for the third time now.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.880
How did the evidence from the Zhou family massacre

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.340
end up in your possession?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.760
Between these two cases,

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.360
there must be some connection.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.880
We could have all escaped together.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.920
Why did you do this?

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.240
Why?
