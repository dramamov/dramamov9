00:39.831 --> 00:41.833
Somebody got shot!

00:44.044 --> 00:46.337
Boys, come here.
Y'all boys come here! Come here!

00:51.760 --> 00:53.887
-You sure she got shot?
-Yes!

00:56.347 --> 00:58.183
Oh my God! Why did she do this?

02:43.788 --> 02:48.001
But from my understanding,
everybody, all the kids,

02:48.585 --> 02:50.253
has problems with this lady.

04:41.823 --> 04:45.910
I called because the lady across the
street on the phone hit me with a sign.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.122
Her children were walking their dog
on the property.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.915
It clearly says, "No Trespassing."

04:50.999 --> 04:52.375
And they're always walking the dog.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.835
The dog's always taking a crap.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.004
There's poop on the sidewalk.
All kinds of stuff.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.714
I said, "Can you keep the dog over there?"

04:57.797 --> 04:59.340
I was going to take a picture of her dog

04:59.424 --> 05:01.718
and she said,
"Don't take a picture of my children."

05:01.801 --> 05:02.677
And I'm like, "Nah."

05:02.760 --> 05:04.429
And then she just got in my face

05:04.512 --> 05:07.181
and she picked up the sign
and threw it at me.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.599
And it hit me in the leg.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.101
It's harassing people, like,

08:39.185 --> 08:40.186
you don't own this.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.354
You can't tell people…

14:36.917 --> 14:38.836
Lots of children screaming
their fool heads off,

14:38.919 --> 14:40.087
running around.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.631
I had my truck parked in front of here,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.842
so I didn't have to listen
to the screaming and yelling.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.303
As soon as I moved the truck,
the kids are coming up.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.762
I'm like, guys, stop.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.807
They know they're not supposed to be
here. They've been told a million times.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.059
And the little kid tells me
to shut up to my face.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.478
I said, "Don't be disrespectful to me."

14:56.562 --> 14:58.480
And he's exchanging words back and forth.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.650
I'm like, "Listen, my name is Dr. Lorincz.
Don't tell me to shut up."

15:01.734 --> 15:03.319
And he was calling me names and I'm like,

15:03.402 --> 15:04.904
no, no, no, we're not going to do that.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.453
I took my son to question
the one whose face that she was in.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.907
Then she got an air horn.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.297
And I mean, she gunned her engine so hard.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.758
I swear, I thought
one of these kids was hit.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.092
I swear.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.511
And she just kept on
flying out the neighborhood.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.311
I'm sorry, I panicked.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.647
And then the guy locked me in there,
I thought…

26:47.731 --> 26:51.026
I'm sorry. I've been previously raped
and beaten.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.777
And so I panicked.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.070
I mean, I really panicked.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.072
And then I thought I was in trouble.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.949
Like, I thought
someone was going to harm me.

31:49.657 --> 31:52.911
We're gonna take off,
but can you guys just do me a favor?

31:54.037 --> 31:56.664
Just keep an eye on your kids
and make sure they don't go over there?

31:56.748 --> 32:00.627
Because I think we all
appreciate not getting a bunch of calls

32:00.710 --> 32:02.712
to come over here
over and over about nothing.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.869
They just keep…
They're trespassing, trespassing.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.705
Called an officer out last night,
nobody shows up.

34:42.789 --> 34:47.752
I guess the mother of the children
may have interceded.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.295
She was out there waiting.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.049
I mean, I just have
the burnt sign that they threw.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.343
I'm like, all right,
you're sending me a message.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.677
Thank you so much.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.270
I like being honest with everybody

35:06.354 --> 35:09.398
so they know exactly
what's set down and done for them.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.985
This is basically just gonna be
an official police document

35:13.069 --> 35:16.572
because you don't have video proof…

35:16.656 --> 35:17.615
I know.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.617
…of the arson and the criminal mischief.

35:19.700 --> 35:23.788
So it will just be a police document,
more or less.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.930
We got kids trespassing, standing
there, leaving all the toys around,

37:46.013 --> 37:49.934
just screaming, yelling,
just being absolutely obnoxious.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.979
I went and threw the roller skates
over to the other side.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.147
The kid says,
"I'm going to beat you up for that."

37:56.941 --> 37:58.943
Yeah, there are
several kids out there now.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.444
I'm fearing for my life.

38:01.028 --> 38:02.321
I'm very scared.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.326
No.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.453
And the kid's saying I took his iPad

38:09.537 --> 38:12.123
and all this other shady shit
that isn't true.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.001
I don't like the kids threatening
me that they'll beat me up,

38:15.084 --> 38:17.128
that they're going to get
someone else to kill me.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.213
This is just ridiculous.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.632
They just keep badgering me
and badgering me.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.467
I'm just sick of these children.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.762
Now that they're home from school,
it's like, you know,

38:27.763 --> 38:28.931
craziness.

38:39.817 --> 38:40.693
Please. Yes.

38:42.361 --> 38:43.988
Because what's going to happen is,

38:44.071 --> 38:45.740
his mom's gonna go
and wait for the officer,

38:45.823 --> 38:48.075
and run and say,
"Oh my God," I was threatening her kid.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.827
Which just isn't true.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.128
Okay, thanks.

40:23.879 --> 40:25.256
Call 911!

40:34.181 --> 40:36.142
Hey, call 911!

40:45.651 --> 40:47.278
Please!

40:48.154 --> 40:49.447
She shot my mom!

40:50.781 --> 40:52.575
-Who shot your mom?
-The Karen!

40:52.658 --> 40:54.118
With a freaking gun!

41:54.678 --> 41:57.306
Oh my God, this lady just tried
to break down my door.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.309
I shot through the door.

42:00.392 --> 42:01.852
Oh my God!

42:06.148 --> 42:07.983
Susan Lorincz.

42:12.029 --> 42:16.283
I didn't know what to do.
I grabbed my gun and I shot at the door

42:16.367 --> 42:18.494
and I thought she was gonna kill me.

42:24.458 --> 42:27.545
Yes. She's come after me several times

42:27.628 --> 42:30.464
because of her children,
her children keep trespassing over here.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.717
They're bothering me and bothering me.
They won't fucking stop.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.683
Her boys were here earlier.

42:40.766 --> 42:43.519
They keep leaving their garbage
all around the house.

42:43.602 --> 42:45.563
And then I told them
to take the crap away,

42:45.646 --> 42:47.398
get the fuck outta here.

44:40.094 --> 44:43.013
I'd like him to close the door.
I have two cats inside.

46:30.454 --> 46:31.955
Why would you shoot her?

46:35.042 --> 46:36.251
Why would you shoot her?

51:09.274 --> 51:11.693
I'm gonna tell them. I'll tell them.

55:21.818 --> 55:23.111
I'm sorry, Isaac.

55:29.826 --> 55:33.997
Football. That's what
they play over there. Football.

01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:59.270
All right, Susan, I put
all those items in your purse, okay?

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.522
They're on the hood of the car.

01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:08.279
Again, we're just trying
to make sure you're safe and everything.

01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:10.781
-Understood.
-But just please call…

01:06:23.896 --> 01:06:26.524
Yeah, this doesn't mean
they get to break her shit.
