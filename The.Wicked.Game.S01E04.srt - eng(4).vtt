00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:01.670
That's all.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.670
It was nothing.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.950
Just a simple greeting.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.720
Come on. What do I have to do
for you to believe me?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.980
I really have no interest in your sister.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:24.180
I love the way you get all flustered
trying to explain yourself.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.750
Are you worried I'll get angry?

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.050
Of course, I'm your subordinate.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.660
I shouldn't have any involvement
with your sister, right?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.660
That's the right way to think.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.110
From now on, you are not allowed
to have any involvement with Risa.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.080
Understand?

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.670
Hmm.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:51.710
But if you get involved with me...

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.280
I don't mind.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.010
Enough.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.380
No more talking.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.030
I'm going to take a shower.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.170
Oh, you even locked the door?

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.069
You can go now.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.400
Risa.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.320
I'll only say this to you once.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.250
Some things can be shared.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.950
But there are some things
I don't like to share.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.310
If you're talking about Than,

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.780
I have no interest in him whatsoever.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.400
Even if you do,

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.380
you can only think about it.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.220
Pheem,

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.000
I won't touch

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:01.800
what belongs to you.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.170
Right now, we're competing against Chet.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.070
I have no time
to think about other things.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.570
Don't worry about that.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.970
I've sent someone to investigate Chet.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.670
We'll have results soon.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.300
But please stay out of my business.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.450
Uncle, thank you very much,

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.310
regarding Dad's health center project.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.050
If you weren't in charge of this project,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.650
I wouldn't have helped.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.800
But I only helped because I'm very close

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.800
to your mother's family.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.050
Once I take over Dad's position,

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.450
I guarantee we'll have
many more collaborative projects.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.900
If you have any advice for me,

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.920
please tell me.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.020
Of course.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.700
As long as you are obedient,

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.220
you'll have a bright future.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.120
Hello, Pheem, it's done.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.970
Senator Surasak.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.100
The one responsible
for liaising with the government

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.630
for investment
in our health center project.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.380
Has he colluded with Chet?

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.450
I think so.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.020
As soon as Chet kicked me out,

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.000
he immediately called a press conference,
preparing to sign a contract with Dad.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.320
It seems this senator

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.700
has a whole chain
of drug corruption cases on him.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.030
But no one can touch him.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.050
He works for Mr. Chet.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.970
If they successfully
sign a contract with Mr. Thanet,

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.200
we're finished.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:31.220
Pheem.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.800
If they sign a contract successfully,
it'll be all over.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
What should we do?

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.550
This way, please.

You already made an appointment
with them, right?

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.800
Yes.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.320
Everything will go smoothly this time.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.400
Hmm, I'm on my way there.

What happened?

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.420
An explosion occurred
in front of the famous golf course.

The car owner is said to be
Senator Surasak Bowon Thaweesap.

What news?

about the cause of the explosion for now.

But the news has blown up on social media.

Someone disclosed
confidential investment documents

for multiple projects signed by him,

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.750
including the Retirement Housing Project
facing construction issues.

We definitely didn't do
what's in the news.

Let's talk outside.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.320
Are you crazy?

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.050
You're the one who's crazy, Pheem!

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.250
Was it necessary to go this far, Pheem?

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.300
What did I do?

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.600
The car explosion!

Didn't you see the news?

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.420
Look how many people came forward
to expose him.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.480
It's normal that a bad person like him
has many enemies.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.900
But with him dead,
you're the only ones who benefit.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:43.660
Is this just a coincidence, Pheem?

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.520
Who said we're the only beneficiaries?

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.720
Why do you always wrongfully accuse me?

There are plenty of people
who benefit from this!

I really don't understand you.
Why are you so angry?

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.550
The world is a little more peaceful

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.310
with a bad person like him dead, isn't it?

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.350
He was a bad person, that's true, Pheem.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.180
But it doesn't have to be solved this way!

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.920
Then what other way is there?

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.680
Waiting for cops like you to handle it?

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.570
You said it yourself.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.830
You said he had a long list of cases,

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.120
but nothing could be done about him.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:24.900
Didn't you?

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.720
Since the law
can't eliminate bad people like him,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.570
consider it karma.

Than is just a bodyguard.

Why does he dare to argue
with a boss like Pheem?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Because Pheem

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.260
cares about Than more than he should.

Why are you apologizing to me, Pheem?

have gotten involved with you!

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.160
Good evening.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:57.470
It's been such a long time.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.330
What did you just mean?

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.530
Mr. Arun and I have decided

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.660
to jointly launch
a community waste recycling project.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.120
Sorry.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.340
But... you came a little too late.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:20.020
Recycling?

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.840
I didn't expect you to be interested
in something like this.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.410
Oh, because my date is interested in it.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.370
Oh, here he comes.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.260
Pheem.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.840
Hello, Dad.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:52.930
Hello, Chet.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:46.770
Darn it!

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:54.160
Pheem deliberately had someone
snatch the funding before us.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.930
He's never shown any respect for you, Dad.

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:01.480
I told you long ago,
Pheem has never considered us family!

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.630
That guy from the mistress
only causes trouble

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:04.520
and ruins us!

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.400
Shut up!

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.520
Stop arguing and think of a solution.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.610
You go back first, Than.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:41.530
I have something to discuss with Jason.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:43.810
I can wait.

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.990
I'll send you back after you're done.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.240
You don't need to wait for me.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.420
I can go back myself.

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:52.020
Go back and rest.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.300
I'm free tonight.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.840
What's wrong, Pheem?

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:57.760
Nothing.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.700
Wait a sec.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:05.910
Go home and rest.

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.730
I'll message you when I get back.

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.390
Your bodyguardâ€”

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.520
what's his name again?

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:48.500
Than, right?

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.170
Why are you asking about him?

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:52.650
You seem distracted.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.950
Are you thinking about him?

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.380
He's just a subordinate.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.930
Why would I think about him?

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:02.360
Good.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.920
Because when you're with me,

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.700
I don't like you
thinking about someone else.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.210
Okay.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:53.230
If you change your mind and need me
to pick you up, just say the word.

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:58.280
What should I do if Pheem gets everything?

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.450
Don't worry, Mr. Chet.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:01.580
I will absolutely not let that happen.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.660
It's good to make them suspect each other.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.260
Once you're no longer useful,
Pheem will kick you to the curb too!

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.620
Pheem, this time,
Chet definitely won't get away.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:16.680
Who's here, Pheem?

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.970
Tell me.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.340
What will it take for you
to not be angry with me anymore?

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.730
I'm not your dog.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:25.440
I won't wag my tail or fetch a ball
on your command.

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.640
From now on, we'll only talk about work.
