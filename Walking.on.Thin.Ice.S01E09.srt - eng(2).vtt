LEE KYUNG,
YOU WERE NOT SELECTED

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:03.876
Drink! Drink!

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:06.667
Drink!

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:07.918
Are you okay?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.167
Get out of the way!

00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:34.959
Are you okay?

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:36.626
Get up.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.999
Hey, stop right there.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.959
You can't leave this place sober.
That's the rule.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.959
Isn't that right?
Right?

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:49.834
Hey, have a drink.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.999
Chug this,
and you can go home.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.667
You can do it, come on.

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:05.125
Drink! Drink!

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.250
Wow! Seriously?

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:17.584
How is it? Huh?

00:02:18.918 --> 00:02:20.083
Are you okay?

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:24.709
Hey.

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:55.667
Hey... Hey...

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.667
Hey!

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:50.125
You took the dead kid there,
and you supplied the drug too.

00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:54.500
Everyone there said so.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.834
Got it?
Just admit it.

00:04:12.382 --> 00:04:14.132
My fiancé's family called off

00:04:14.144 --> 00:04:16.460
the engagement because
my brother is a murderer.

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:18.999
And TwoN said they're canceling
the joint contract

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.959
because you made
Kang Hwirim do drugs.

00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:23.612
Our father's company is
about to go bankrupt.

00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:25.674
Do you understand
what you've done?

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:28.893
Bro, it wasn't me. Really!

00:04:28.908 --> 00:04:31.432
Then why did only you
and the dead kid have the drug?

00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:35.612
You make me sick.

00:04:41.542 --> 00:04:43.275
This is the last time I see you.

00:04:53.478 --> 00:04:55.999
The 70th birthday celebration for
Twon Group's chairman Kang Gunam

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.999
was held at the TwoN Hotel
today afternoon,

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.999
where prominent business and
political figures made their appearance.

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.209
In particular, Kang Hwirim,
the chairman's eldest grandson,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.792
returned from his studies abroad
to attend the event,

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:10.375
drawing high attention.

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:14.417
Some observers speculate
that Chairman Kang may be signaling

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:17.667
the beginning of a succession process
within the group.

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:20.959
A source at the event said
Chairman Kang

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.834
made no special mention of succession,

00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:26.999
but his remarks emphasizing
family harmony stood out,

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:31.292
and the eldest grandson's return
seemed symbolic.

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.630
Meanwhile, Chairman Kang appeared
cheerful throughout the event,

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.125
greeting attendees personally,

00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:40.000
and displayed a relaxed demeanor.

00:05:50.152 --> 00:05:51.834
You haven't changed at all.

00:05:51.876 --> 00:05:55.709
It's been six years,
and you're still saying it wasn't you?

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.334
I know you don't believe me.

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:02.227
I'll prove it. Just watch.

00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:04.813
How? With your ludicrous plan?

00:06:05.203 --> 00:06:06.797
TwoN isn't a tiny local store.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.167
Fine, let's say we bring on board
the corporate raider Austin,

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:16.667
bring in auditors, file objections,

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.395
and make timely purchases.

00:06:18.426 --> 00:06:20.999
Still, for us to exercise
the shareholder proposal right,

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:24.918
we need at least 0.5%
of Twon Holdings shares.

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:26.876
- Do you know how much that is?
- 8 billion won.

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:42.584
Are you after
our father's company money?

00:06:42.698 --> 00:06:45.584
If I were, I wouldn't have
come to see you.

00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:52.077
So then what?
How will you get the money?

00:07:06.213 --> 00:07:10.542
Don't worry.
I found a way to get it.

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.000

What happened?

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:30.626
What's going on?

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.709
Where are you?
Answer the phone.

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:37.709
It's not that important, go on.

00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:42.751
Well, studying abroad requires a visa
and lots of admission paperwork.

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:45.097
It'll take some time,
but if you're in a hurry,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.909
one option is to go abroad under a
language-study program and prepare there.

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:52.480
For that, you'll need an F1 visa.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.022
Will the whole family be going together?

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.667
BASTARD

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.999
You don't care if I exposed you
to Kang Hwirim?

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:10.334
Don't think about running,
I know where you are.

He's basically my boss.

What?

00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:17.458
He's a retailer
and I'm a wholesaler.

- I need a little more time.

00:11:26.042 --> 00:11:27.834
Are you screwing me over
with Kang Eunsoo?

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:29.758
You're both finished.

00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:33.918
I'll show you
just how far I can go.

00:11:58.918 --> 00:11:59.792
Where's my money?

00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:02.042
I told you,
it's not your money.

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:09.999
If I die, the drug disappears too.

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:11.500
You think there aren't other drugs?

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:15.225
It's the only one
that can be cashed right now.

00:12:15.514 --> 00:12:17.876
You're desperate for money,
aren't you?

00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:22.374
I think we're not so different,
you know?

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:36.834
If I don't go downstairs in ten,
they'll call the police.

00:12:57.286 --> 00:12:58.494
You're a funny woman.

00:13:05.898 --> 00:13:07.959
Did you think I'd come unprepared?

00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:12.999
What you want is the drug, isn't it?

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.628
Then buy it—20 billion won.

00:13:17.792 --> 00:13:20.042
That's a steal compared to its real value.

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:25.803
You're clueless, aren't you?

00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:30.478
If I wanted the drug,
I would've taken it already.

00:13:30.525 --> 00:13:33.518
You want no risk
and all the money, huh?

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:35.999
Well, not anymore.

00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:37.682
Pay for what you get.

00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:40.375
I could burn your house down.
Can you handle that?

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:44.091
That'd mean no more drug.
Can you handle that?

00:14:00.246 --> 00:14:00.999
Yeah.

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:02.209
Sir, where are you?

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.083
It's a disaster,
the inspection team is here!

00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:14.168
You'd better decide quickly
before I change my mind.

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:37.125
Are you crazy?

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.603
Have you forgotten?
He's the police!

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:43.236
He knows a thousand ways
to fuck us over for good!

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.502
Is that why you lied to me?

00:14:46.542 --> 00:14:48.876
I had a plan for both of us!

00:14:48.918 --> 00:14:51.751
If you had waited,
everything would've worked out!

00:14:51.792 --> 00:14:52.999
Wait until when?

00:14:54.174 --> 00:14:58.375
You said you'll catch the blackmailer
while I get the money.

00:14:58.734 --> 00:15:02.435
I got fired from my job and spent
all of my husband's medical fees.

00:15:02.719 --> 00:15:06.382
I worked sleeplessly, but couldn't even
earn my living expenses.

00:15:07.209 --> 00:15:10.834
Everything I'm trying to protect
is falling apart.

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:13.292
And you teamed up with him
and deceived me!

00:15:15.542 --> 00:15:19.334
You know what hurts me the most?

00:15:20.042 --> 00:15:25.000
That you knew my situation
better than anyone.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.696
Yet you betrayed me.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.918
No, I didn't mean to betray you...

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:36.959
I guess I trusted you too much.

00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:41.959
Shit. Out of all the people
in the world...

00:15:42.552 --> 00:15:45.092
I trusted someone
who only cares for himself.

00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:54.584
Eunsoo, let me explain.
I'll tell you what I had in mind.

00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:57.751
It's too late!

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:27.417
December 1, 2021. Drug Task Force,
Inspector Jang Taegu.

00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:29.959
We'll be questioning you about
Sergeant Choi Gyeongdo.

00:16:30.334 --> 00:16:32.042
Is Inspector Jang Taegu here?

00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:33.125
3 Hours Ago

00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:35.792
He's not here right now.
What is it?

00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:39.792
This is an inspection notice.
Who is Sergeant Choi Kyung-do?

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.626
- Yes, that's me.
- Please come with us.

00:16:43.792 --> 00:16:46.042
LETTER OF INVESTIGATION COOPERATION

00:16:51.743 --> 00:16:52.493
Wait...

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.292
The most recent Bitcoin transfer
by Phantom's Do Gyuman

00:17:04.334 --> 00:17:06.999
amounts to roughly 40 million won.

00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:12.999
As you can see, 40 million was withdrawn
from a borrowed account on Nov 29th.

00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:18.709
And on that same day,
you withdrew cash from the bank.

00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:21.999
This isn't what you think.
There's a misunderstanding...

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:25.500
You also have matching
text message records

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:28.999
with Do Gyuman's subordinate,
Hwang Donghyun.

00:17:31.999 --> 00:17:33.709
11-MONTH PLAN, 1.6% FIXED RATE.
UP TO 40 MILLION

00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:41.723
That's not mine.
It's not my money.

00:17:42.667 --> 00:17:44.348
Even though it was found
on your desk?

00:17:44.626 --> 00:17:45.465
What?

00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:52.000
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:53.999
Phantom has another informant.

00:17:53.999 --> 00:17:56.167
Ask Do Gyuman
about money-grubber.

00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:58.999
He said they never met in person.

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:02.876
They did anonymous trades to avoid
cases like this, right?

00:18:03.334 --> 00:18:06.083
I can explain everything.

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:09.125
Here's what happened...

00:18:09.167 --> 00:18:10.710
I never did that.

00:18:10.764 --> 00:18:13.834
How could I give
that kind of money to someone?

00:18:13.876 --> 00:18:16.218
My housing deposit
isn't even worth 40 million.

00:18:16.249 --> 00:18:20.584
No, he definitely gave me
10 million in cash first,

00:18:20.626 --> 00:18:24.209
then lent me more through
another account for tax reasons.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.643
Then is there anyone who saw or heard
Inspector Jang give you the money?

00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:34.417
I knew he was struggling
with his loan payments,

00:18:34.459 --> 00:18:37.599
but I never imagined
he'd take Phantom's bribe.

00:18:38.857 --> 00:18:42.083
It's all my fault.
I should've watched over him better.

00:18:45.713 --> 00:18:48.963
That means there's no witness
or physical evidence!

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:50.918
Look here.

00:18:51.334 --> 00:18:54.709
If you check the documents
Inspector Jang submitted,

00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:58.292
he transferred the ownership
of his house

00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:01.125
and his car to his ex-wife last year,

00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:03.731
and most of his salary
goes toward child support.

00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:06.375
He denied everything you've said.

00:19:06.417 --> 00:19:11.703
As of now, there's no evidence
to support your claim.

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:15.999
If what you say is true,

00:19:15.999 --> 00:19:19.999
it means Inspector Jang
framed you on purpose.

00:19:20.152 --> 00:19:23.792
Why would he do that
to his subordinate, huh?

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.601
For what reason?

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.792
Come on, give us an answer!

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.626
Should we clean it up?

00:19:59.959 --> 00:20:02.999
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT
KANG EUNSOO ACTED ALONE

00:20:08.495 --> 00:20:09.578
Sergeant Choi.

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:12.626
Sergeant Choi?

00:20:13.209 --> 00:20:17.125
It was him.
He was the one...

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:24.584
Bastard, where did you
hide the drug?

00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:42.125
NAME: KIM MINWOO

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:45.451
We caught him using your drug.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.250
NEXT PAYMENT DUE DATE: 11/25/2021
AMOUNT DUE: 2.3 MILLION WON

00:21:06.584 --> 00:21:07.999
11-MONTH PLAN, 1.6% FIXED RATE.
UP TO 40 MILLION

00:22:08.999 --> 00:22:14.167
55 Haengbok-ro 32-gil.
Green gate house, in the bedroom blanket.

00:22:15.312 --> 00:22:16.936
What's this, boss?

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.209
I don't really need big money.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.999
I'll definitely pay you back.

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.083
Hey!

00:22:58.459 --> 00:23:00.918
How could you?
Out of all people!

00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:02.834
Think about your wife and child.

00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:07.209
What did you do to my family?

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.886
Your accounts should be frozen by now.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.542
If you want your severance,
you'd better act properly.

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:18.417
It's the better choice for your family.

00:23:29.053 --> 00:23:32.388
- What are you two doing?
- Don't worry.

00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:34.626
It's nothing.

00:23:36.388 --> 00:23:37.928
I said it's fine.

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.145
I warned you.

00:24:04.792 --> 00:24:06.751
I told you not to try so hard.

00:24:35.101 --> 00:24:38.792
Yes, counselor.
The documents will be ready tomorrow.

00:24:38.952 --> 00:24:42.792
Of course. I'm just doing
some final corrections.

00:24:43.975 --> 00:24:46.852
Yes, no problem.

00:24:50.209 --> 00:24:51.584
NEWBIE

00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:57.999
Hey, it's me.

00:24:57.999 --> 00:25:02.250
If you don't make progress by today,
I'm clearing your desk. Got it?

00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:04.334
Yes, sir.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.139
Exams are over,
but don't stop studying.

00:25:28.216 --> 00:25:31.053
- Maybe read a book.
- Ma'am, please...

00:25:31.417 --> 00:25:34.999
And if you can reach
those absent today, let me know.

00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:36.250
Yes, ma'am.

00:25:36.292 --> 00:25:39.209
Good job on the exam.
Bye.

00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:59.334
- Don't, stop it! Please!
- Let go!

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.125
Honey! Honey! Honey!

00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:10.099
Honey! Honey!
Honey! Honey!

00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:16.999
Why didn't you come today?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.999
YOON JINHEE

00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:46.542
JINHEE

00:26:58.334 --> 00:27:01.999
Jinhee, how long
will you skip school?

00:27:46.935 --> 00:27:47.893
Are you okay, sir?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.292
Let go!

00:28:18.792 --> 00:28:21.626
Should I keep doing
what you asked for?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.999
Yeah, but move it up a few days.

00:28:34.834 --> 00:28:36.626
KANG HWIRIM

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.667
I could burn your house down.

00:28:54.042 --> 00:28:55.417
Can you handle that?

00:29:06.042 --> 00:29:07.626
It's okay, relax.

00:29:13.167 --> 00:29:15.210
Mom, you came to pick me up?

00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:18.240
Yeah. Well done
on finishing your exams.

00:29:25.542 --> 00:29:26.834
You worked hard.

00:29:26.876 --> 00:29:29.999
- I think I did well.
- Really?

00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:31.999
- What do you want to eat?
- Something tasty.

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:40.375
Eat this.

00:29:40.417 --> 00:29:42.542
Stop playing.

00:29:43.292 --> 00:29:45.999
- Apologize.
- I'm sorry.

00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:52.709
YOU HAVE BEEN HIRED

00:29:55.999 --> 00:29:57.250
Bro...

00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.999
Argh, damn.

00:30:00.801 --> 00:30:03.459
- You got it!
- For real?

00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:04.876
Let me see.

00:30:04.925 --> 00:30:08.503
WE'RE PLEASED TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HIRED

00:30:10.162 --> 00:30:12.432
Junhyun!

00:30:57.218 --> 00:30:58.552
Damn old geezer.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.000
He threw an ashtray at me
for selling some stock.

00:31:01.823 --> 00:31:02.782
What are you talking about?

00:31:03.853 --> 00:31:08.269
I needed cash to buy your stuff,
so I sold some shares. Why?

00:31:10.459 --> 00:31:13.459
- How much?
- Why? Will you buy them back for me?

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:17.682
Anyway, give me Vaka.
I'm out.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.042
I don't have it on me.

00:31:28.367 --> 00:31:33.146
Sorry, my bad.
I can't grip well these days.

00:31:35.202 --> 00:31:39.371
Too bad.
I'll have to call your partner.

00:31:39.751 --> 00:31:40.583
My partner?

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.595
A lady came to me,
saying she'd sell me everything.

00:31:46.662 --> 00:31:49.328
Turns out you've been
ripping me off.

00:31:49.892 --> 00:31:53.004
I even bought your damn artwork.

00:31:53.114 --> 00:31:56.231
You're the one who said
money laundering via NFT was great.

00:31:56.262 --> 00:31:58.523
Whatever, I don't give a shit.

00:32:00.403 --> 00:32:04.292
First one to bring me Vaka wins.
Got it?

00:32:24.417 --> 00:32:26.999
How did Eunsoo find out about Hwirim?

00:32:27.083 --> 00:32:29.999
I trusted someone
who only cares for himself.

00:32:37.792 --> 00:32:39.542
SHOW HIDDEN APPS

00:32:39.584 --> 00:32:41.500
LOCATION TRACKER

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.500
LINKED DEVICES - LEE KYUNG, KANG EUNSOO

00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:55.568
I really underestimated this bitch.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.375
BRO

00:33:04.865 --> 00:33:07.905
Bro, check TwoN Chairman Kang's
disclosure right now.

00:33:08.334 --> 00:33:09.999
I think Kang Hwirim screwed up.

00:33:12.999 --> 00:33:17.334
Why does he freak out
whenever I mention TwoN stocks?

00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:19.999
You knew about
the IR presentation schedule?

00:33:20.209 --> 00:33:22.083
You must've bought a lot.

00:33:32.292 --> 00:33:34.751
- Listen to me.
- Yes, Director Kang.

00:33:34.792 --> 00:33:37.042
Bring me our shareholder list.

00:33:57.959 --> 00:34:00.709
I did the rough grading,
and my average went up.

00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:02.592
That's great, sweetie.

00:34:05.876 --> 00:34:08.876
But Jinhee turned in a blank sheet.

00:34:09.959 --> 00:34:11.584
She hasn't come to school for days.

00:34:12.846 --> 00:34:15.626
I heard from girls living
in the same building

00:34:15.667 --> 00:34:18.834
that her mom is getting fired,
and her dad is never home.

00:34:19.999 --> 00:34:22.375
She's ghosting texts
and won't answer calls.

00:34:24.628 --> 00:34:26.295
Honestly, I don't get it.

00:34:27.061 --> 00:34:29.646
I understand Jinhee's mom
did something bad,

00:34:30.292 --> 00:34:32.792
but it doesn't feel like
she's the only one at fault.

00:34:35.076 --> 00:34:37.933
If there's a drug user,
that means there's a seller.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.059
Right, Mom?

00:34:55.375 --> 00:34:56.417
Are you crazy?

00:34:56.544 --> 00:34:58.084
Can't you see the light?

00:34:58.691 --> 00:34:59.999
Are you blind or something?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.626
Are you okay?

00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:03.292
I'm sorry...

00:35:04.084 --> 00:35:06.193
This is all your fault!

00:35:06.999 --> 00:35:07.999
Where's my money?

00:35:15.999 --> 00:35:17.167
Mom?

00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:19.315
What's wrong, Mom?

00:35:19.877 --> 00:35:25.542
Uh, I just... spaced out for a second.

00:35:26.077 --> 00:35:27.287
You've been really weird lately.

00:35:29.209 --> 00:35:30.209
Is something going on?

00:35:35.223 --> 00:35:36.182
Here.

00:35:38.542 --> 00:35:40.209
Huh? This is...

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:44.834
It's the school you wanted to attend.

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:47.292
Your favorite painter studied there.

00:35:47.334 --> 00:35:49.570
I can't just go because I want to.

00:35:49.999 --> 00:35:52.584
If you could, would you?

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.083
Delivery job.
Wanna do it?

00:35:59.125 --> 00:36:03.125
Mom, I forgot I had plans.
Let's talk at home.

00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:06.999
With who? Hey, Sua!

00:36:07.626 --> 00:36:08.876
I'll see you later.

00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:20.375
I only found out today myself.

00:36:21.456 --> 00:36:25.584
The problem is that Chairman Kang
bought twice what Hwirim sold.

00:36:25.626 --> 00:36:27.999
0.07% costs at least
one billion won.

00:36:28.823 --> 00:36:31.042
We barely stitched together 0.5%.

00:36:32.167 --> 00:36:35.999
Even with Austin and the small holders,
we still can't top TwoN's stake.

00:36:37.439 --> 00:36:39.983
Austin won't buy more
than what we first offered.

00:36:40.667 --> 00:36:42.861
He says profit on price
is all he needs.

00:36:45.792 --> 00:36:48.918
IR's around the corner.
We can't get a billion in time.

00:36:50.918 --> 00:36:52.999
I can scrape up
100 to 200 million at most.

00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:55.297
I even thought about pulling
Seonjoong Construction's funds.

00:36:56.077 --> 00:37:00.578
But if we touch that,
we'll lose our purpose.

00:37:01.417 --> 00:37:04.792
- Listen, I'll find a way...
- Kyung.

00:37:07.496 --> 00:37:08.550
Let's give up.

00:37:08.584 --> 00:37:10.840
It was out of our league.

00:37:10.913 --> 00:37:14.956
You and I....
We both did all we could.

00:37:21.291 --> 00:37:25.022
I have to go.
I need to be somewhere with Dad.

00:37:26.218 --> 00:37:31.125
After you left like that,
he worried a lot.

00:37:31.789 --> 00:37:35.996
Even if you give up now,
he'll forgive you someday.

00:38:46.538 --> 00:38:48.162
Oh, you're awake.

00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:51.386
Where did your guardian go?

00:38:52.653 --> 00:38:54.945
- Guardian?
- Your father.

00:38:55.043 --> 00:38:58.167
He came as soon as we called.
He was out of breath.

00:39:00.751 --> 00:39:02.584
Hey, where are you going?

00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:06.444
Dad! Dad! Dad!

00:39:06.584 --> 00:39:10.526
I'm sorry!
I'll fix everything, I promise!

00:39:11.042 --> 00:39:14.042
- Dad, I promise!
- Stay back.

00:39:14.083 --> 00:39:15.959
Dad!

00:39:21.334 --> 00:39:24.834
Dad! Dad!

00:39:26.147 --> 00:39:27.648
Dad!

00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:30.083
Dad!

00:39:47.588 --> 00:39:48.622
No.

00:39:51.844 --> 00:39:52.786
I'm not giving up.

00:40:01.167 --> 00:40:02.542
MOONGANG UNIVERSITY

00:40:06.209 --> 00:40:08.500
SUMMONS TO APPEAR

00:40:21.999 --> 00:40:23.667
DIVORCE APPLICATION

APPLICANT: YOON MOSEOK

00:40:56.167 --> 00:40:57.834
I'm home.

00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:08.391
Mom?

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.292
Mom! Mom...

00:41:24.334 --> 00:41:25.167
Mom!

00:41:25.584 --> 00:41:27.834
M-Mom, what's wrong?

00:41:27.876 --> 00:41:29.125
Mom!

00:41:37.876 --> 00:41:42.224
Sir, did you hear everything I said?

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:45.042
Ah, yes.

00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:47.603
Please relay it to your guardian

00:41:47.634 --> 00:41:49.999
and come together when readmitting.

00:42:01.317 --> 00:42:03.591
Honey! Are you okay?

00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:05.417
Honey!

00:42:06.982 --> 00:42:08.107
Honey!

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.999
What's the condition?

00:42:09.999 --> 00:42:12.626
Unconscious from
an overdose of sleeping pills.

00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:13.999
We'll proceed with gastric lavage.

00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:17.834
Honey! Honey! Honey!

00:42:17.876 --> 00:42:19.209
Honey!

00:42:19.584 --> 00:42:20.792
Honey!

00:42:23.903 --> 00:42:25.695
Why are you asking these questions?

00:42:25.999 --> 00:42:29.751
My wife has nothing to do
with Miyeon's case.

00:42:29.792 --> 00:42:31.999
Mrs. Kang has no direct connection.

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:35.124
Are you implying
there's some indirect link?

00:42:35.287 --> 00:42:36.898
I'm curious about that myself.

00:42:47.045 --> 00:42:49.213
- Prep quickly.
- Yes, doctor.

00:42:55.375 --> 00:42:56.999
Intubating.
Draw the curtain.

00:42:56.999 --> 00:42:59.792
Mom... Mom...

00:42:59.834 --> 00:43:02.250
Will Mom be okay?

00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:05.918
Will she die?
Is Mom going to die?

00:43:06.999 --> 00:43:08.700
No one's going to die!

00:43:09.903 --> 00:43:12.542
Go home and bring Mom's stuff.
Her clothes and her ID.

00:43:12.584 --> 00:43:16.918
It's me... It's my fault...

00:43:16.959 --> 00:43:17.918
Hurry!

00:43:49.834 --> 00:43:53.607
She probably didn't know
she was pregnant.

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.597
I'm sorry.

00:44:20.533 --> 00:44:23.000
Where are you? It's urgent.

00:44:23.042 --> 00:44:25.709
Is it true we're losing the house?

00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:30.500
Honey, it hurts so much.
I'm bleeding like something's wrong.

00:44:34.918 --> 00:44:37.334
DONGBU CITY HOSPITAL

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:42.626
Patient Hwang Junhyun
has regained consciousness.

00:44:42.651 --> 00:44:43.983
Please come promptly.

00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:12.000
You scared me!

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:13.209
STUDY ABROAD TO SHINE

00:45:16.542 --> 00:45:17.999
You scared me more.

00:45:19.792 --> 00:45:20.999
What brings you here?

00:45:20.999 --> 00:45:24.417
I came to check on Dojin.
Wondering what the doctor said.

00:45:25.125 --> 00:45:28.751
What's all this?
Are you going abroad?

00:45:32.805 --> 00:45:35.346
Seriously? All of a sudden?

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.837
For treatment?
You should've told me...

00:45:39.167 --> 00:45:41.999
- Must I tell you everything?
- No.

00:45:43.194 --> 00:45:44.695
But you're my best friend.

00:45:45.139 --> 00:45:47.786
Thanks for helping,
but this is a family matter.

00:45:50.834 --> 00:45:52.042
What about the money?

00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:55.883
You won't get insured in the US.
What about Sua?

00:45:55.883 --> 00:45:57.999
Back off.
It's my business.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.191
My husband and my daughter.

00:46:01.073 --> 00:46:03.082
You should leave.
I'll call later.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.626
SUA'S STUDY-ABROAD PLAN

00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:17.918
PORTFOLIO DAY

00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:28.417
INITIAL SETTLEMENT COSTS

00:47:28.459 --> 00:47:31.083
FINAL REQUIRED AMOUNT: 2 BILLION WON

00:48:05.584 --> 00:48:06.918
Where did it go?

00:48:08.276 --> 00:48:09.735
Where's Sua's stuff?

00:48:15.334 --> 00:48:16.500
It's gone.

00:48:19.292 --> 00:48:22.709
Oh, you're home.
You left the door open again.

00:48:22.751 --> 00:48:24.294
What did the doctor say?

00:48:24.918 --> 00:48:25.852
What are you doing?

00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:31.292
Sua's passport is missing.
Didn't we renew it?

00:48:31.334 --> 00:48:32.999
Why do you need it?

00:48:32.999 --> 00:48:34.665
To study abroad, of course.

00:48:34.688 --> 00:48:37.667
Abroad?
Is Sua going abroad?

00:48:39.334 --> 00:48:44.375
Yeah, a great opportunity came up.

00:48:44.417 --> 00:48:50.078
If we miss it, she can't go.
So I made a decision.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.560
I don't think that's
the only decision you made.

00:48:58.751 --> 00:49:01.000
INVESTMENT IMMIGRATION:
ONE BILLION WON AFTER 5 YRS OF RESIDENCE

00:49:01.661 --> 00:49:03.951
Investment immigration?
Two billion won?

00:49:04.959 --> 00:49:06.792
Planning to leave for good?

00:49:07.189 --> 00:49:09.667
Is that why you told me
to get my medical records?

00:49:10.417 --> 00:49:13.999
How will you get 2 billion?
Explain the police!

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.542
Why are they suspecting that
you're involved with Miyeon?

00:49:19.709 --> 00:49:21.709
Why do we have to leave?

00:49:23.184 --> 00:49:24.893
What have you done?

00:49:30.999 --> 00:49:32.125
Uh...

00:49:47.876 --> 00:49:48.999
The day after tomorrow?

00:49:49.375 --> 00:49:54.834
I wanted to take more time,
but we can't now.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:50:01.459
I booked a place and rental car
under your name,

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:05.000
and enrolled you and Sua
in a language school.

00:50:05.042 --> 00:50:07.667
Be sure to attend the interview
to get the visa.

00:50:07.709 --> 00:50:09.961
- You can get treatment there...
- Stop!

00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:17.410
Honey, you know
I've never been wrong.

00:50:17.584 --> 00:50:20.999
Can't you trust me just once more?

00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:22.957
I'll explain everything later.

00:50:24.082 --> 00:50:25.459
Explain now,
or I won't go anywhere.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.417
No, just do as I say.

00:50:29.166 --> 00:50:32.265
It's all for our family.

00:50:32.667 --> 00:50:36.265
Just shut up and listen to me!

00:51:21.918 --> 00:51:23.918
Why wasn't I on this?

00:51:25.375 --> 00:51:26.709
Why was I missing?

00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:29.403
Thanks for helping,
but this is a family matter.

00:51:29.412 --> 00:51:31.328
My husband and my daughter.

00:51:47.999 --> 00:51:50.209
We're going to be rich, aren't we?

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.834
Of course.

00:51:52.417 --> 00:51:55.569
And then,
I'll actually live here.

00:51:55.577 --> 00:51:57.959
When I do, I'll open a sauna.

00:51:57.999 --> 00:52:01.292
- Fine, you do that.
- Okay.

00:52:05.083 --> 00:52:07.500
I want a house with 100 bathrooms.

00:52:07.542 --> 00:52:08.626
100 bathrooms?

00:52:45.834 --> 00:52:46.999
SUA

00:52:53.542 --> 00:52:55.667
Why isn't she answering?

00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:11.876
The number you have dialed
could not be reached.

00:53:22.584 --> 00:53:25.125
Alright, let's do the deal.

00:53:25.959 --> 00:53:27.083
Meet now.

00:54:12.533 --> 00:54:13.783
PARTNER

00:54:16.626 --> 00:54:18.125
PARTNER

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.918
The number you have dialed
could not be reached.

00:54:29.959 --> 00:54:31.999
Leave a message after the beep.

00:54:38.918 --> 00:54:39.542
KANG HWIRIM

00:54:40.999 --> 00:54:43.292
KANG HWIRIM

00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:47.999
Yeah.

00:54:47.999 --> 00:54:50.876
Come now, and I'll buy from you.
Last chance.

00:55:28.545 --> 00:55:33.709
Let's trade here.
455, Gilsong-ri, Jeongdan-eup, Namyangju.

00:55:52.375 --> 00:55:54.042
SHAREHOLDER REGISTER

00:56:22.375 --> 00:56:24.709
SHAREHOLDER REGISTER

00:56:28.584 --> 00:56:30.999
GOLD ART GALLERY

00:56:43.417 --> 00:56:45.653
Excuse me!
Do you remember me?

00:56:45.677 --> 00:56:49.209
I was told Patient Hwang Junhyun
regained consciousness.

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:50.719
Where is he now?

00:56:50.758 --> 00:56:53.336
Ah, well...

00:57:08.918 --> 00:57:11.918
Thanks for helping.
I owe you a big time.

00:57:11.959 --> 00:57:13.876
It's good money.
I had to accept the job.

00:57:15.584 --> 00:57:17.334
You're so clumsy.

00:57:18.667 --> 00:57:20.984
How could you slip
on a steep road?

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:26.042
I wonder what this is.
It's not actual jelly, right?

00:57:26.083 --> 00:57:29.125
Probably sleeping pills
or diet meds.

00:57:29.706 --> 00:57:31.268
As long as we get paid.

00:57:31.584 --> 00:57:34.561
How will you spend your cut?

00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:38.279
Secret.

00:57:56.999 --> 00:58:00.000
Good luck.
See you tomorrow.

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:01.747
Let's become rich and eat tteokbokki.

00:58:02.751 --> 00:58:04.042
- I'm off.
- Bye.

00:58:21.459 --> 00:58:23.083
E-TICKET

00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:25.250
FROM INCHEON
TO SEATTLE

01:01:42.334 --> 01:01:43.792
What the hell?

01:01:47.209 --> 01:01:48.417
Who are you?

01:02:02.999 --> 01:02:04.250
I did it!

01:02:41.667 --> 01:02:42.999
We're here.

01:02:50.751 --> 01:02:51.999
SUA

01:03:13.959 --> 01:03:18.500

DRUG TASK FORCE
SGT. CHOI KYUNGDO

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:58.876
INSPECTOR JANG

01:04:09.834 --> 01:04:13.792
NEWBIE

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:23.542
Excuse me.

01:04:28.959 --> 01:04:30.584
I'm here to file a report.

01:06:10.292 --> 01:06:13.167
WALKING ON THIN ICE

01:06:14.751 --> 01:06:17.753
It was you.
You made her that way!

01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:21.792
I have a condition... James.

01:06:22.459 --> 01:06:23.417
Run!

01:06:25.819 --> 01:06:29.792
Maybe you and I
are not so different.

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:32.866
Mom, what will happen to me?

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.083
We can't let him drag us around forever.

01:06:35.498 --> 01:06:40.139
Anyone who touches
my daughter or my family...

01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:43.250
I will kill.
