Gosh, I'm sorry.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.250
[Sejung's friend 2] What's your problem?

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.876

I couldn't tell from behind.

-Let me see.
-Guys, stop it.

00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:39.349
Give the adults some alone time, will you?

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.685
-I'm a grown-up, too.
-Let's go!

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:02.581
They've probably left by now, right?

-[♪ whimsical music playing]
-I suppose so.

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:09.421
You have lipstick on your...

No, the other side.

Right.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.056
We should hurry out.

-Right.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:21.975

You don't have one?

No.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.364
Oh, no.

How was your business trip?

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.965
Oh, it went well.
I just got back yesterday.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.592
I heard you visited the house
while I was away.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.553
None of our stuff was organized,

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.513
so it might have looked like
no one was living there.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:42.973
[chuckles]

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.809
You must have some free time
since it's the weekend.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.144
Oh, right.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.020
My husband is extremely busy.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.565
Even I can't get a hold of him
on weekdays. [chuckles]

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.567
Sweetie, don't take on too much work.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.193
It'll cost you your health.

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.737
I've been working out,
so don't worry, sweetie.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.823
-Got it, sweetie.
-Sure.

Are you going to work out?

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.412
I was planning to play some squash.
Would you like to join me?

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.874
I'm afraid we already have plans.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:12.419
We had to call it off once before,
so we can't do that again.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.005
That's right. We already have plans.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.674

Don't you know
offense is the best defense?

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.985
He was clearly suspicious last time.

With you gone... What are you doing?

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.113

-Shall we?
-Sure.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.089
Is this absolutely necessary?

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.467
[Kim Wooju] I thought offense
was the best defense.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.676
[Meri chuckles] True.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.554
Slow down, will you?

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.097
Walk faster.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.975
My slipper's slipping off.

[Kim Wooju] That belongs in the trash.

[Meri] Now you're just being mean.

Geez.

[Ms. Oh] Right here,

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.135
you can see the sales
from last year's holiday season.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:49.474
These were a huge hit
because of the duty-free promotional deal.

That's good to hear.
I'll make a copy of this.

Where did you see Mr. Kim?

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.481
Sejung saw Mr. Kim
at a self-service photo studio.

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:48.950
and saw someone who looked like Mr. Kim
taking wedding photos.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.076
Wedding photos?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.454
[clears throat] You must've been mistaken.
[chuckles nervously]

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.872
Exactly.

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.540
Why would Mr. Kim go there?

00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:56.750
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.044
[Sejung] It seemed
like a themed photo shoot,

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.630
but the guy looked exactly
like Mr. Kim from behind.

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.466
-Tall with a petite head.
-[Wonseok] A petite head.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.009
[Sejung] His hair had two parts.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.303
My hair also has two parts.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:09.679
See?

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:10.889
Go away!

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.724
-Did you see the woman?
-[Sejung] Sorry?

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.435
If it was a wedding photo,
there would've been a girl.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.073
She was a lot like you.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.788
She had a figure
similar to yours, Ms. Yoo.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.749
The height and everything.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.168
She was just like you.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.547
You should've seen her face.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.925
Her face? Well...

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.511
I couldn't because they were kissing.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.765
-Were they kissing?
-[Sejung] Yes.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.267
Their lips were locked.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:59.270
Why don't you check with the photo studio?

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.315
Check who reserved that time slot.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.609
[Ms. Oh gasps] Ms. Shin, you genius!

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.655
You're right. Why didn't I think of that?

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:11.825
I have the studio's number on my phone.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.785
-[Wonseok] Give them a call.
-Wait.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:15.745
-Here we go.
-I don't think...

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.748
I don't think they will share
personal information.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.960
Hello, is this
the self-service photo studio?

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.046
I was hoping to ask you something.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.423
Ms. Cha!

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.091
I have something to ask.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.468
Shall we begin the meeting?

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.721
-Ms. Yoo.
-[Meri] I have something to say.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:34.389
-I mean, ask...
-[Sejung] What was that?

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.516
I can't quite hear you.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.770
[Ms. Oh] Ms. Yoo,
can I have your attention?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.773
I had the reservation
put under a different name just in case.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:44.983
Tosun, to be exact.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.068
[sighs in relief]

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.696
Couldn't you have told me that?

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.072
I was sweating in there.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:54.325
That's your fault for booking a studio
close to the office.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.369
People could've seen us.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.205
I thought it would be safer
near the office

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.249
because it was the weekend.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.169
Anyway, I'm sorry. I'll be more careful.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:08.548
-Has Mr. Baek reached out since that day?
-No.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.176
I'm going to cancel the home visit
as soon as I can.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.011
How?

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:14.929
[hums thoughtfully]

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:18.183
We could be in a car accident,
or a family member could die.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.144
Wow, you lie like nobody's business.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.854
Avoiding him should be a priority.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.398
Things won't go well for you
if I get caught.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.401
-Are you blackmailing me?
-Of course not!

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.279
Is that how I came off?

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:35.241
It's just that
I didn't want to put you out anymore.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:39.037
The wedding photos we took together
were more than enough.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:40.997
Ah!

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.208
The wedding photos...

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.459
You know,

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.253
I'm only saying this just in case.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:51.132
I hope you don't read too much into it.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:52.759
A modeling gig.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.220
Just think of it as that.

00:09:55.303 --> 00:10:00.058
[scoffs] I'm sorry to say this,
but that's how I've always seen it.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.144
You seem to be reading
more into it than I am.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:04.646
-Me?
-It looked like

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:08.149
you were getting what you want
by pretending it's for wedding photos.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.361
You caught me off guard
by swooping in like that.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.072
-I swooped in?
-[♪ upbeat dramatic music playing]

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.573
Mr. Kim?

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.701
[Sejung gasps]

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.624
I was simply worried she'd catch us.

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:28.002
It definitely felt like
I locked eyes with Sejung.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:29.337
Besides, the kiss?

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.089
You started it.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.424
I never meant for things to go that far.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.928
All I wanted to do was
to get us into a certain pose.

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:40.265
But all of a sudden,
you came at me like a bull...

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:42.392
[scoffs] "Like a bull"?

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.435
You've got to be kidding me.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:48.982
Just know that I wasn't trying to get
anything from you.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.278
What was that look just now?

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:54.445
Don't you believe me?

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.156
[♪ dramatic sting]

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.741
[hesitates]

00:10:58.825 --> 00:10:59.909
Whatever.

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.078
Here.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.330
I got you some clothes and shoes.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.584
I actually needed these. [gasps]

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.752
No way. Even your underwear?

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:12.881
You're good with details, aren't you?

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.924
That's how you get work done.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.093
Meticulously, without missing a detail.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:19.762
Consider me schooled.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.056
Return the favor with good work.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.145
The chairwoman liked the design proposal.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.480
She wants to hear from you in person.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.316
Really?

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.276
Hold on a second.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.320
If they like this new design,

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:39.908
could they ask us to update the packaging
for their current products?

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.284
Yes.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.078
Think of the range of products
Myungsoondang has.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.581
We'll tackle this project
like it's do or die.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.750
Don't pop the champagne too soon.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.003
Myungsoondang's chairwoman is no joke.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.087
How so?

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:57.467
-Isn't she the founder's daughter-in-law?
-She is.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.263
She took the small steamed bun shop
her mother-in-law ran at the market

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:05.350
and turned it into the Myungsoondang
we know today.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.684
Despite being over 70,

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:10.647
she visits the factory every morning
and samples every product.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.608
She also looks after the health
and well-being of her bakers.

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:14.776
That's admirable.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.528
-[exclaims quizzically]
-I want the job even more now.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.864
People like her
tend to stay loyal, you know.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.741
They never change
their view of you, either.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:22.951
That's true.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:25.578
It's settled.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:26.955
I'm pulling all-nighters.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.123
I'll be ready with even Plans B and C.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:34.128
Did everything go smoothly at the funeral?

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:37.090
Yes, the ceremony was simple
because he had a small family.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.424
You did well.

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.302
I talked to Mr. Ko's wife this morning.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.681
He was still quite young.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.645
Assist the family
in any way the company can.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.939
Maybe find a job for his wife
in the company.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:57.777
Of course. However,
there's something I must report.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.447
It seems like Mr. Ko

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.075
was embezzling company money.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.577
What are you talking about?

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.038
The internal audit team caught him
the day before the accident.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.123
When questioned,

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.292
he admitted to gambling.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.668
[♪ tense, melancholy music playing]

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.587
He promised to pay the money back
with his severance after retiring,

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.215
but then the accident happened.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:20.758
Gambling?

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.679
[sighs] He wouldn't have.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.307
[sighs] I couldn't believe it, either,

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.977
but you never really know people.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.021
[sighs softly]

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.399
He took a sizable amount,
so what should we do?

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:40.820
If we file a police report,
the press could get wind of it.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.489
What do you think we should do?

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:48.494
It's wrong to speak ill of the dead,
and he was a loyal employee,

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.538
so I believe
it'd be wise to keep this quiet.

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:55.668
[♪ ominous sting]

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:03.259
For now, Eungsoo will fill in for Mr. Ko.

00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:04.761
What?

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:05.928
Me?

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.389
Accounting really isn't my strong suit.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:11.350
This will just be a temporary role
until we hire someone.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.895
I'll supervise the team myself,
so don't worry.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.481
I'd feel better knowing
you'll be taking charge.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.941
You could show Eungsoo
how the work is done.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.026
Sure.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.278
I'll get back to my meal.

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.783
[sighs] Talk about a bomb going off.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.787
Mr. Ko and his wife
even had a meal here with us once.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.871
Right?

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:36.250
They were excited to win a vacation
for his long service to the company.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.044
You should always drive carefully.

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:39.754
He's lucky it was just him.

00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:41.297
What if his family were with him?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.007
They'd all have been killed--

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.092
Honey.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.218
What?

We all know the story, don't we?

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.857
It shouldn't really be taboo
in the family.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.822
Wooju, I wasn't trying to upset you.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.241

I'd like to excuse myself.

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.603
Didn't he like the food? [clears throat]
He must be picky.

Then how would I be able to eat?

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.486
Just shut your mouth

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.488
and stop talking nonsense
at the dinner table.

You always pick on me.

[Eungsoo] Mom, he isn't fine.

but Wooju is more fainthearted
than he seems

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.250

I don't know where he found it,

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:10.970
but it became his comfort toy.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.124
we will soon arrive in Gangnam,

[Kim Wooju] With this renewal,

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:21.854
we hope to strengthen our brand identity
across all customer demographics.

PACKAGE RENEWAL STATUS UPDATE

00:41:23.523 --> 00:41:26.776
The new packaging design
will be used on small gift packages,

00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:30.697
our website's purchase pages,
and gift features on social media.

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:37.537
We hope the new mascot in the design
will help attract a younger customer base.

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:39.330
There are ads on social media,

00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:42.375
plus vouchers and coupons, but...

I made some side dishes,

[Meri] My in-laws?

I'll go there and try to stop your mom.

Don't you and your daughter talk?

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:26.354
It was called off ages ago.

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:27.438
Wait.

What do you mean it was called off?

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.026
This is news to me.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.612
If you have any questions,
talk to your daughter.

00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:36.364
We've got nothing more to say.

00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:38.324
Hold on.

00:43:39.075 --> 00:43:42.662
Ms. Chun, don't be like this.

00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:45.206
They probably argued a little,

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:48.668
but that's common for couples
before getting married.

00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:52.588
If Meri did something wrong,
I'll set her straight.

00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:55.174
A wedding isn't something
to play around with.

00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:59.720
Ms. Chun, why don't you cool off
and take this?

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:02.849
I made you
some of the side dishes you love.

I say this because I feel bad for you.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:33.880
This isn't a lovers' spat.

00:44:33.963 --> 00:44:35.256
It's over between them.

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.216
You know how your daughter is.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.593
She's vicious and nasty.

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:41.596
No guy would be able to handle her.

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:45.808
She had the audacity to snap back at me
with her eyes glaring.

00:44:45.892 --> 00:44:47.935
You should've taught her better.

00:44:48.436 --> 00:44:51.147
It would've been a mistake
to let her into this family.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.107
I thank our ancestors
for watching over us.

00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.275
Hallelujah.

00:44:54.984 --> 00:44:57.653
Anyway, if you have any decency,

don't marry her off
until she grows as a person.

00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:03.159

even as a little girl,
she was bold and outspoken.

Her drawings were so good
that she won an award from the governor.

In school, she always led
the art projects. [chuckles]

she had to step up

Supporting herself through college
and living away from home

00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:48.199

00:47:48.282 --> 00:47:51.577

might misunderstand her.

Wow, she made so much food.

Always so generous, isn't she?

Hey, Mom. What's up?

Unbelievable.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:17.859
I've looked everywhere.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:20.028
It isn't in any of my pockets.

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:23.990
No way. I didn't even pull
my wallet out on the bus.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.576
Goodness.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.203
You know what?

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:31.539
I must have dropped it there.

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:34.167
In Mr. Kim's car?

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.420
Sure, I'll ask.

01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:39.089

I'll look for it.

My dad gave it to me as a birthday gift.

The girl I'd been looking for

[Kim Wooju] That when harsh winds

[student] Oh, no.

[Kim Wooju] She cried for me.

[clears throat]

01:05:58.496 --> 01:05:59.664

What are you doing this weekend?

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.549
Shouldn't you have
a wedding photo or something?

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:11.092
That'd lower his suspicion.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:13.636
He was clearly suspicious last time.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.054
With you gone...

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.264

Do you want to know...

[Kim Wooju] But I never asked

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:33.740
if she remembered me.

This was enough distance.

I was repaying the favor

isn't it?

[Meri] Didn't you say to team up
with Wooju if push came to shove?

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.359
[Kim Wooju] Maybe it's because I like you.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.361
I don't like seeing you with another guy.

01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:37.530
